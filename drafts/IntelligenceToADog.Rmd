A weird thing is happening. I do not like weird things very much. They make me want to bark at them.

It started a long time ago. It was TV time. I was playing with Ferret, while Mommy and Daddy were watching the wall. Well, sort of watching. Daddy was looking at a thing in his paw and Mommy was snuggling with Sister. All of a sudden, the wall made a loud scraping noise, and then light stopped coming out of it. Daddy groaned. Then he got up from the couch, walked over to the wall, and crouched to fiddle with the ropes-I-am-not-allowed-to-chew. I dropped Ferret and poked Daddy with my nose.

"Go snuggle on the couch with Mommy and Sister," Daddy said. He sounded very angry, and I knew he left a warm spot next to Mommy, so I turned around and jumped onto his spot on the couch.

"Not myâ€¦ Goddamnit," Daddy said. Mommy laughed and scratched my head, which I like very much.
