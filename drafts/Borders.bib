  abstract = "Background Immigrants are a growing segment of the US population.
              In 2003, there were 33.5 million immigrants, accounting for 12\%
              of the total US population. Despite a rapid increase in their
              numbers, little information exists as to how immigrants' health
              and mortality profile has changed over time. In this study, we
              analysed trends in social and behavioural characteristics, life
              expectancy, and mortality patterns of immigrants and the US-born
              from 1979 to 2003.Methods We used national mortality and census
              data (1979--2003) and 1993 and 2003 National Health Interview
              Surveys to examine nativity differentials over time in health and
              social characteristics. Life tables, age-adjusted death rates,
              and logistic regression were used to examine nativity
              differentials.Results During 1979--81, immigrants had 2.3 years
              longer life expectancy than the US-born (76.2 vs 73.9 years). The
              difference increased to 3.4 years in 1999--2001 (80.0 vs 76.6
              years). Nativity differentials in mortality increased over time
              for major cancers, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, respiratory
              diseases, unintentional injuries, and suicide, with immigrants
              experiencing generally lower mortality than the US-born in each
              period. Specifically, in 1999--2001, immigrants had at least 30\%
              lower mortality from lung and oesophageal cancer, COPD, suicide,
              and HIV/AIDS, but at least 50\% higher mortality from stomach and
              liver cancer than the US-born. Nativity differentials in
              mortality, health, and behavioural characteristics varied
              substantially by ethnicity.Conclusions Growing ethnic
              heterogeneity of the immigrant population, and its migration
              selectivity and continuing advantages in behavioural
              characteristics may partly explain the overall widening health
              gaps between immigrants and the US-born.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: The US immigrant population has grown considerably
                 in the last three decades, from 9.6 million in 1970 to 32.5
                 million in 2002. However, this unprecedented population rise
                 has not been accompanied by increased immigrant health
                 monitoring. In this study, we examined the extent to which US-
                 and foreign-born blacks, whites, Asians, and Hispanics differ
                 in their health, life expectancy, and mortality patterns
                 across the life course. METHODS: We used National Vital
                 Statistics System (1986-2000) and National Health Interview
                 Survey (1992-1995) data to examine nativity differentials in
                 health outcomes. Logistic regression and age-adjusted death
                 rates were used to examine differentials. RESULTS: Male and
                 female immigrants had, respectively, 3.4 and 2.5 years longer
                 life expectancy than the US-born. Compared to their US-born
                 counterparts, black immigrant men and women had, respectively,
                 9.4 and 7.8 years longer life expectancy, but Chinese,
                 Japanese, and Filipino immigrants had lower life expectancy.
                 Most immigrant groups had lower risks of infant mortality and
                 low birthweight than the US-born. Consistent with the
                 acculturation hypothesis, immigrants' risks of disability and
                 chronic disease morbidity increased with increasing length of
                 residence. Cancer and other chronic disease mortality patterns
                 for immigrants and natives varied considerably, with Asian
                 Immigrants experiencing substantially higher stomach, liver
                 and cervical cancer mortality than the US-born. Immigrants,
                 however, had significantly lower mortality from lung,
                 colorectal, breast, prostate and esophageal cancer,
                 cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis, diabetes, respiratory
                 diseases, HIV/AIDS, and suicide. INTERPRETATION: Migration
                 selectivity, social support, socio-economic, and behavioural
                 characteristics may account for health differentials between
                 immigrants and the US-born.",
