# Before

Before, there was nothing. All was silence and stillness and empty. 'Empty' implies a place without things. Before, there was no place.

Then, with a cataclysmic noise, there was a place. A place with things in it.

It wasn't good or bad. It was just... stuff. Something. Hydrogen.

The stuff formed clumps. Huge clumps that burned. Stars formed and burned. Merged and collapsed. Novaed and Supernovaed. Spun around each other in simple dances. Inside, they transformed the stuff that made them. Took Hydrogen and forged Helium, Lithium, Beryllium, Boron.

Carbon.

As the universe continued to cool, smaller, cooler clumps of stuff formed. Rocks bumped into each other, accumulated into comets, asteroids, rocky little terrestrial planets, and fluffy gas giants.

And for nine billion years, nothing more happened.

# Then

But then, one day, the most interesting thing in the universe happened. Some atoms somewhere near an unremarkable yellow star accidentally linked up in exactly the right way, and became a replicator.

The replicator wasn't like the stuff it was made out of. Rather, the replicator could do something really special and interesting. It could take the stuff around it, and turn that stuff into other replicators, just like it.

Well, mostly like it. Sometimes, replicators grabbed molecules that were like the ones they were made out of, but not exactly the same. Most of the time, that meant the new replicator wouldn't work. Once in awhile, it meant the new replicator worked **better**.

Things continued like this for a while. Replicators replicated, occasionally stumbling upon a better formulation. This halting, accidental process built protections for the replicators: shells and excess reserves of their raw materials. More replicators, more replications.

Some replicators replicated one way. Some other replicators replicated another. The first way worked well, and those replicators' descendants (bacteria) got bigger. The second way worked well, and those replicators' descendants (archaea) stayed small.

Sometimes a bacterium would find an archaeon, and use it for parts to make another bacterium. It was a replicator-eat-replicator world.

And for another half of a billion years, nothing more happened.

But then, one day, a bacterium found an archaeon and tried eat the archaeon to use it for parts, and it didn't work. Instead, the archaeon lived inside the bacterium. The bacterium ate lots of things the archaeon could use to make more archaeon right inside the bacterium. The archaeon, in turn, threw away parts it didn't need, but that the bacterium did. That saved the bacterium all the trouble of making those things itself. It was an unexpected and beautiful relationship.

Together, the bacterium and the archaeon had formed something new. The first complex life.

Everything living thing that we can see with our naked eyes is descended from this life. You and I are both its grandchildren.

# Now

Humans exist in a dangerous, adversarial environment. The brutal truth of our reality is that there is only one inviolate set of laws in the universe: the laws of physics. And they *desperately* want you dead.

We are likely to lose.

# Forever

But what if we don't lose? What does the victory of humanity look like?
