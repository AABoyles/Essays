title: "It Isn't Aliens"
---

There are a lot of interesting mysteries in the astronomy world right now. Why does the light emmitted by [Tabby's Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KIC_8462852) vary cyclically? What caused the [spike in radiation from HD164595](http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=36248)?

Let me take one hypothesis off of the table: It isn't aliens.

# HD164595

A Kardashev I Civilization could target us.

A Kardashev II Civilization could do it omnidirectionally.

95 Light-years away

Information takes a 190-year round trip.
