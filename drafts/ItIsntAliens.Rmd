title: "It Isn't Aliens"

# Introduction

There are a lot of interesting mysteries in the astronomy world right now. Why does the light emmitted by [Tabby's Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KIC_8462852) vary cyclically? What caused the [spike in radiation from HD164595](http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=36248)?

Let me take one hypothesis off of the table: It isn't aliens.

# Setting a Good Prior

In Bayesian Probability theory, your "prior" is the probability you estimate for something before you consider new evidence. Among other things, an explicit prior tells you how convincing evidence must be in order to make you change your mind.

In this case, our prior is our estimate that intelligent, technologically sophisticated aliens exist within our light cone. Once we have a prior, we can add in new evidence (cases in which astronomical data might be explained by alien activity), and *update* our beliefs. The new belief is called the "posterior" probability.

## The Drake Equation

$$N = R_{\ast} \cdot f_p \cdot n_e \cdot f_{\ell} \cdot f_i \cdot f_c \cdot L$$

where:

$N$ = the number of civilizations in our galaxy with which communication might be possible (i.e. which are in our current light cone)
$R*$ = the average rate of star formation in our galaxy
$f_p$ = the fraction of those stars that have planets
$n_e$ = the average number of planets that can potentially support life per star that has planets
$f_{ell}$ = the fraction of planets that could support life that actually develop life at some point
$f_i$ = the fraction of planets with life that actually go on to develop intelligent life (civilizations)
$f_c$ = the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space
$L$ = the length of time for which such civilizations release detectable signals into space

## The Great Silence

Here's where our most important piece of empirical data comes in: we have no evidence of aliens. At all. Like, we don't know if there are so much as microbes outside of Earth, much less intelligent, technologically sophisticated life.

This state of affairs is called "the Great Silence."

## The Prime Directive or the Galactic Zoo

It is conceivable that we haven't been contacted because there is some institution which prevents others from reaching out to us. In Star Trek, there was a Prime Directive

A second formulation of this hypothesis is the Galactic Zoo. It's possible that humans are isolated so that we may be observed, somehow.

## The Great Filter

The simpler (and thereby preferable) explanation for the Great Silence is the Great Filter. We don't hear anyone else out there because there is no one else out there. At some point in the development of advanced civilizations, their extinction becomes a near-certainty. If it is early in their evolution (abiogenesis and endosymbiosis are both good candidates), then we have a shot at colonizing the stars. If it is late in their evolution (catastrophic anthropogenic climate change, for example), then it is extremely likely humans will go extinct soon.

An early Great Filter explains the Great Silence. A late Great Filter does not.

## So, what's P(Aliens)?

The probability that aliens exist is quite high. The probability that intelligent aliens exist is quite low. The probability that an alien intelligence is doing something we could observe is very nearly zero. Thus, in order to conclude that an unexplained phenomenon originates from alien life, we require overwhelming evidence.

# HD164595

On May 15, 2015, at 18:01:15.65 (local time), the RATAN-600 radio telescope in Zelenchukskaya, Russia detected ["a strong signal in the direction of HD164595."](http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=36248)

At 95 Light Years away, A Kardashev I Civilization could target us. This would require approximately $10^9$ watts, or approximately the power consumption of human civilization today, [according to Seth Shostack](http://www.seti.org/seti-institute/a-seti-signal), [Senior Astronomer](http://www.seti.org/users/seth-shostak) at [SETI](http://www.seti.org/).

95 Light-years away, which means information takes a 190-year round trip. 190 years ago, we weren't broadcasting anything.

A Kardashev II Civilization transmit a signal like this omnidirectionally. Then the required power is on the order of $10^{20}$ watts.

In a [helpfully patient forum post](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/forum_thread.php?id=80193), Berkeley Astronomer Eric Korpela explained why this really isn't actually an interesting event.

> I looked over the presentation. I was unimpressed. In one out of 39 scans that passed over star showed a signal at about 4.5 times the mean noise power with a profile somewhat like the beam profile. Of course SETI@home has seen millions of potential signals with similar characteristics, but it takes more than that to make a good candidate. Multiple detections are a minimum criterion.

Korpela [followed up with a helpful list of things to look for when you think you've found an interesting signal](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/forum_thread.php?id=80193:

> We believe a signal when
> - It is persistent. It appears at the same spot in the sky in multiple observations.
> - It only comes from one spot in the sky.
> - If we reobserve the target, the signal is still there.

> Things that add to believability
> - Its frequency/period/delay does not correspond to known interference.
> - Its Doppler Drift rate indicates that it is exactly frequency stable in the frame of the center of mass of the solar system
> - Its properties (bandwidth, chirp rate, encoding) indicate intelligent origin.

> Unfortunately the observing method used by the Russian team does not permit many of these things to be determine. 1) The signal was not persistent. 2) The signal was gone when the target was reobserved. 3) The signal frequency/period/delay cannot be determined. 4) The signal Doppler drift rate is unknown. 5) Many sources of interference, including satellites, are present in the observing band.

Korpela's [original post](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/forum_thread.php?id=80193) also gave us a useful list of alternative hypotheses:

> Because the receivers used were making broad band measurements, there's really nothing about this "signal" that would distinguish it from a natural radio transient (stellar flare, active galactic nucleus, microlensing of a background source, etc.) There's also nothing that could distinguish it from a satellite passing through the telescope field of view. All in all, it's relatively uninteresting from a SETI standpoint.

## Terrestrial Interference

A [Comment from the Russian News Agency, TASS](http://tass.com/science/896683)

> Director of the Institute of Applied Astronomy at the Russian Academy of Sciences Alexander Ipatov told TASS that back at the Soviet period he had been part of a group of young astronomers at the special astrophysical observatory searching for signals from extraterrestrial civilizations.
> "We, indeed, discovered an unusual signal. However, an additional check showed that it was emanating from a Soviet military satellite, which had not been entered into any of the catalogs of celestial bodies," Ipatov said.

The [Official Comment from the Russian Space Agency](https://www.sao.ru/Doc-en/SciNews/2016/Sotnikova/):

>  Subsequent processing and analysis of the signal revealed its most probable terrestrial origin. [...] As for the other objects of the RATAN-600 survey, it is too early to claim about any reliable scientific results. Using the obtained measurements, we are only able to estimate the upper limit of the detection of the studied areas. It can be said with confidence that no sought-for signal has been detected yet. 

# Tabby's Star

1400 Light Years Away

[SETI observation has revealed no anomalous transmissions](http://www.seti.org/seti-institute/press-release/looking-deliberate-radio-signals-kic-8462852).

## Dyson Sphere?

> Finally, note that any society able to build a Dyson swarm would have access to energy at a level approaching $10^27$ watts.

A Dyson Sphere should only take a capable civilization [a few dozen years](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576513001148).

## A lot of Comets?

We don't know yet.

# Estimating a Posterior

P(Aliens|Evidence) = P(Aliens) * P(Evidence|Aliens) / P(Evidence)

The answer is that our evidence is vastly smaller than the threshold we should require to conclude that intelligent, technologically sophisticated aliens exist in our light cone.
