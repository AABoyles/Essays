title: "Estimating the Risk of Human Extinction by Catastrophic Global Warfare"
---

Most of the Great Filter candidates lack any empirical evidence, and thus are tantamount to impossible to estimate. We have comparatively excellent data on warfare.

## The Outside View

Back in the 40's, a Meteorologist named [Lewis Fry Richardson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Fry_Richardson) figured out that armed conflict follows a Power Law Distribution. *The bigger the war, the less likely it is that such a war will occur*. This point should be pretty intuitive. Lars Erik Cederman [replicated this result](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.143.8098&rep=rep1&type=pdf) in a paper in which he took the casualty estimates from the [Correlates of War](http://www.correlatesofwar.org/). He generated this graph to describe it:

[![The cumulative frequency of wars strongly correlates with the magnitude of said wars.](/imgs/ModelingSizeOfWars.png "I get SO much analytic leverage from this figure.")](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/modeling-the-size-of-wars-from-billiard-balls-to-sandpiles/84FFC9F035902B95419977608C5A628A)

Note the equation describing the regression model:

$$\log{P(S>s)}=1.27-.41 \log s$$

If we accept this model at face value, we must bring many assumptions along with it. Most prominently, we'll assume that wars are independent events, and that the technical ability to scale wars upward is static. Both of these are false, but provide a useful analytical ground upon which to build.

So, using Cederman's model, we can calculate the probability that a random war will end up being of a certain size (i.e. number of casualties). Let us consider the case of an existentially risky war--that is, one in which the entire population of humans was destroyed. At the time of writing (September 2016), the [US Census Bureau estimates](http://www.census.gov/popclock/?intcmp=home_pop) the Global Population to be around 7.338 Billion. The [UN estimates](https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/DataQuery/) that the global popultation in 2016 will eclipse 7.432 Billion. Let's split the difference and say that there are approximately 7.385 billion people.

Here we've accumulated a third important assumption: the global population is static. Again, this is false: it has consistently grown throughout recorded history, save for a moderate recession caused by the black plague. We will investigate this phenomenon in due course, but for now, let it suffice to assume that the global population is (and will continue to be) approximately stagnant at its current level. Setting the magnitude of of the relevant war ($s$), we get:

$$\log P(S>s)=1.27-.41 \log (7.385 * 10^9)$$

And solving for $P(S>s)$ gives us $P(S>s)\approx0.001675$. Thus the probability that any random war will reach the scale of an existential threat is on the order of $.001675$.

Note the word *random*. We can't calculate the probability that the big war is in our upcoming wars directly. However, we can calculate the probability that our set of predicted wars does not contain WWIII (This is a variation on the [Birthday Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem).) The probability of the first war being existentially risky is approximately $.001675$. So the probability of the second war being the big war is $.001675$. And so on (recalling our assumption that wars are independent events). Now, the probability that neither the first war nor the second war is the war which destroys humanity is $(1-.001675)^2 \approx.9967$. Generalizing this formulation:

$$P(S>s|n)=(1-10^{1.27-.41*\log s})^n$$

Now, from here it's just a small logical step to the probability that a war of given magnitude occurs within $n$ wars.

$$P(S<=s|n)=1-(1-10^{1.27-.41*\log s})^n$$

So, how far do we have to look to see the War to end all Wars (by virtue of ending humanity)? More or less fortunately, we cannot estimate this directly: we can only propose probabilities over numbers of wars. So, for example, let's say we're curious about the time frame for which an existentially risky war is 50% likely. Using our previous estimates for the magnitude of an existentially risky war:

$$P(S<=s|n) = .5 \approx 1- (1 - .001675)^n$$

Solving for $n$ gives us $n \approx 413.5$. So an existentially risky war should occur (with probability .5) within 414 wars or so.

## Dealing with Population Dynamics

The global population has grown significantly in the last 10,000 years. As the global population grows, the probability of an existentially risky war drops. Partly, this is because the trend of the probability of a war is inversely correlated with the number of casualties that war will cause.

### Bang, Pow

There is further reason to be optimistic: even a global thermonuclear war is unlikely to destroy every living population humans capable of repopulating the Earth. The greatest danger of an existentially risky war is a scenario in which the human population is decimated ("bang"), and a second catastrophic risk ("pow") finishes off the feeble population. For example, consider a war which kills all but a few tens of thousands of humans. A second war of sufficient magnitude to destroy humanity is vastly more likely, simply by virtue of fewer humans existing to be killed. Neither of these catastrophes need be wars, either. Any global catastrophic risk that doesn't completely wipe out humanity will suffice: a pandemic, near-Earth object collision, or supervolcanic eruption come to mind.

### Dealing with Population Decline

As birth control has become available, fertility rates have dropped, well below the replacement rate in some advanced economies.

## Dealing with New Technology

This outside view provides a rather rosy perspective on the probability of war as existential risk. However, we have thus far neglected the progress of technology.

Humanity has only recently developed the technology to cause disasters on the scale of the entire population. Prior to the dawn of the nuclear era, industrialized warfare threatened hundreds of millions, and killed tens of millions. Prior to the dawn of flight, ground and naval warfare only meaningfully threatened millions of people at once.
