title: "American Revolution Forecast"
---

A Facebook friend of mine recently dropped an odd comment:

> I think revolution isn't too infeasible in the next few decades, depending on lots of economic and political factors.

As forecasts go, this is a pretty miserable one. It contains fuzzy language ("isn't too infeasible"), a long, unfixed timescale ("few decades"), and unclear caveats ("lots of economic and political factors"). Nevertheless, it reflects a sentiment of extreme pessimism that's permeated my own little epistemic closure.

```{r WorldRevolutions}
library('tidyverse')
library('haven')
if(!file.exists("../data-cache/revolutions/Measuring Revolution.COLGAN.2012Nov.dta")){
  download.file("https://sites.google.com/site/jeffdcolgan/data/Revolution%20Data%20v1-1.zip", destfile = '../data-cache/revolutions/rev.zip')
  unzip('../data-cache/revolutions/rev.zip', exdir = '../data-cache/revolutions/')
}
revolutions <- read_dta("~/Projects/Essays/data-cache/revolutions/Measuring Revolution.COLGAN.2012Nov.dta")
```

In terms of the causal processes that generate revolutions, the United States is closer to a randomly-selected country from the last 10 or 20 years than it is to the proto-United States in 1786.
