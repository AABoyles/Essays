On September 26, 1983, the Soviet Union's incoming missile early warning system reported a US missile launch.

The officer on duty was a young Lieutenant Colonel, Stanislav Petrov. Petrov suspected a computer error.

Investigators later determined that sunlight on high-altitude clouds had aligned with the satellite view on a US missile base, triggering the alert.
