Good question! How hard would it be?

## Build a Wall!

> It would continue for days, burying Yellowstone in lava within a 40-mile radius.

To start, let's make some strong assumptions:
  1. the eruption happens (duh)
  2. the surrounding area is reasonably flat ([definitely not true](https://yellowstone.net/maps/terrain/))
  2. the volcano emits enough lava to coat a perfect circle of **exactly** 40 miles

## For Comparison: The Great Wall of China

[The Great Wall of China]() seems like a logical infrastructural project to use for comparison, because it's really, really long. Specifically (according to Wikipedia <- Bloomberg <- Xinhua Article I can't access), it's 21,196 km (or, more usefully, 21,000,000 meters) long. I can't find an especially reputable source for the mean height of the wall, but this site claims it's 6-7 meters, so we'll just pretend it's uniformly 6.5 meters.

```{python}
length = 21000000
height = 6.5
area = length*height
```

Thus, we can see that the area of the wall (that is, the area of the face of the wall)
