title: What could make Wet Transhumanism an EA Priority?

https://www.reddit.com/r/EffectiveAltruism/comments/73b5e4/why_arent_more_eas_interested_in_wet_transhumanism/

List of cause areas:

* Existential Risk Reduction
* Human Health Improvement
* Human Poverty Reduction
* Animal Suffering

List of interventions in Human Health Improvement:

* Malaria Net Distribution
* De-worming Schistosomaisis

Effective Altruists tend to be more rationally persuadable than the general population, so if there were a compelling moral argument, I doubt that the ickiness of transhumanism would be sufficiently off-putting to keep the EA community from buying into the most effective projects thereof.
