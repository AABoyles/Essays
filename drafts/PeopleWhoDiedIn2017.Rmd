title: People Who Died in 2017
---

It felt like [a lot of celebrities died in 2016](http://people.com/celebrity/stars-we-lost-in-2016/) ([see also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQ6WPo-oW5Q)). But the people who make it onto these sorts of lists tend to be, well, popular. It seems to me that the public completely misses the deaths of people whom they should actually aspire to emulate, rather than artists who do things which amuse them. Accordingly, I've collected a short list of people who died in 2017 who did valuable things that most people will never hear about.

As all such lists, this is entirely subjective. [Many noteworthy people die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:2017_deaths) in [any given year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Deaths_by_year). These are simply people who affected *my* life in some way, and whom I wish more people mourned. I'm not going to write extensive biographies or obituaries, just enough context to convey my reasoning for including them on this list. Accordingly, I won't tell you about the manner of their death unless it's salient to my inclusion of them. If you wish to know more, just follow the links.

## Hans Rosling

Swedish Dr. [Hans Rosling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling) [died](http://www.gapminder.org/news/sad-to-announce-hans-rosling-passed-away-this-morning/) on February 7, 2017. He presented [a wide variety of TED and TED-like talks](https://www.gapminder.org/videos/) on demographics and global public health.

## Kenneth Arrow

American Economist [Kenneth Arrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Arrow) died on February 21, 2017. He shared the 1972 Nobel Prize in Economics, and is well-known for his [eponymous impossibility theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem).

## Stanislav Petrov

Soviet Lieutenant Colonel [Stanislav Petrov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov) died on May 19, 2017. He [literally saved the world](/2017/09/Happy-Petrov-Day.html).

## Miriam Mirzakhani

Iranian Mathematician [Maryam Mirzakhani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryam_Mirzakhani) died on July 14, 2017. She was awarded the 2014 Fields Medal for "her outstanding contributions to the dynamics and geometry of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces".

## Anne Dufourmantelle

French philosopher [Anne Dufourmantelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Dufourmantelle) died on July 21, 2017. I must confess that I'd never heard of her before her untimely end, but [she drowned](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40703606) attempting to save two children who were being carried out to sea. The implications of this should be [obvious to modern utilitarians](https://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/199704--.htm).
