  abstract    = "As the level of interest in aging research increases, there is
                 a growing number of geroprotectors, or therapeutic
                 interventions that aim to extend the healthy lifespan and
                 repair or reduce aging-related damage in model organisms and,
                 eventually, in humans. There is a clear need for a
                 manually-curated database of geroprotectors to compile and
                 index their effects on aging and age-related diseases and link
                 these effects to relevant studies and multiple biochemical and
                 drug databases. Here, we introduce the first such resource,
                 Geroprotectors (http://geroprotectors.org). Geroprotectors is
                 a public, rapidly explorable database that catalogs over 250
                 experiments involving over 200 known or candidate
                 geroprotectors that extend lifespan in model organisms. Each
                 compound has a comprehensive profile complete with
                 biochemistry, mechanisms, and lifespan effects in various
                 model organisms, along with information ranging from chemical
                 structure, side effects, and toxicity to FDA drug status.
                 These are presented in a visually intuitive, efficient
                 framework fit for casual browsing or in-depth research alike.
                 Data are linked to the source studies or databases, providing
                 quick and convenient access to original data. The
                 Geroprotectors database facilitates cross-study,
                 cross-organism, and cross-discipline analysis and saves
                 countless hours of inefficient literature and web searching.
                 Geroprotectors is a one-stop, knowledge-sharing, time-saving
                 resource for researchers seeking healthy aging solutions.",

  abstract    = "Ever since eukaryotes subsumed the bacterial ancestor of
                 mitochondria, the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes have had
                 to closely coordinate their activities, as each encode
                 different subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)
                 system. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of aging, but
                 its causes are debated. We show that, during aging, there is a
                 specific loss of mitochondrial, but not nuclear, encoded
                 OXPHOS subunits. We trace the cause to an alternate
                 PGC-1$\alpha$/$\beta$-independent pathway of
                 nuclear-mitochondrial communication that is induced by a
                 decline in nuclear NAD(+) and the accumulation of
                 HIF-1$\alpha$ under normoxic conditions, with parallels to
                 Warburg reprogramming. Deleting SIRT1 accelerates this
                 process, whereas raising NAD(+) levels in old mice restores
                 mitochondrial function to that of a young mouse in a
                 SIRT1-dependent manner. Thus, a pseudohypoxic state that
                 disrupts PGC-1$\alpha$/$\beta$-independent
                 nuclear-mitochondrial communication contributes to the decline
                 in mitochondrial function with age, a process that is
                 apparently reversible.",

                 healthspan after acute stress or natural aging. Senescent
                 cells are thought to impair tissue function, and their genetic
                 clearance can delay features of aging. Identifying how
                 senescent cells avoid apoptosis allows for the prospective
                 design of anti-senescence compounds to address whether
                 homeostasis can also be restored. Here, we identify FOXO4 as a
                 pivot in senescent cell viability. We designed a FOXO4 peptide
                 that perturbs the FOXO4 interaction with p53. In senescent
                 cells, this selectively causes p53 nuclear exclusion and
                 cell-intrinsic apoptosis. Under conditions where it was well
                 tolerated in vivo, this FOXO4 peptide neutralized
                 doxorubicin-induced chemotoxicity. Moreover, it restored
                 fitness, fur density, and renal function in both fast aging
                 Xpd(TTD/TTD) and naturally aged mice. Thus, therapeutic
                 targeting of senescent cells is feasible under conditions
                 where loss of health has already occurred, and in doing so
                 tissue homeostasis can effectively be restored.",

              risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer and mortality, and the
              effects of specific types of fruit and vegetables. We conducted a
              systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify these
              associations. Methods: PubMed and Embase were searched up to 29
              September 2016. Prospective studies of fruit and vegetable intake
              and cardiovascular disease, total cancer and all-cause mortality
              were included. Summary relative risks (RRs) were calculated using
              a random effects model, and the mortality burden globally was
              estimated; 95 studies (142 publications) were included. Results:
              For fruits and vegetables combined, the summary RR per 200 g/day
              was 0.92 [95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.90--0.94, I2 = 0\%, n
              = 15] for coronary heart disease, 0.84 (95\% CI: 0.76--0.92, I2 =
              73\%, n = 10) for stroke, 0.92 (95\% CI: 0.90--0.95, I2 = 31\%, n
              = 13) for cardiovascular disease, 0.97 (95\% CI: 0.95--0.99, I2 =
              49\%, n = 12) for total cancer and 0.90 (95\% CI: 0.87--0.93, I2
              = 83\%, n = 15) for all-cause mortality. Similar associations
              were observed for fruits and vegetables separately. Reductions in
              risk were observed up to 800 g/day for all outcomes except cancer
              (600 g/day). Inverse associations were observed between the
              intake of apples and pears, citrus fruits, green leafy
              vegetables, cruciferous vegetables, and salads and cardiovascular
              disease and all-cause mortality, and between the intake of
              green-yellow vegetables and cruciferous vegetables and total
              cancer risk. An estimated 5.6 and 7.8 million premature deaths
              worldwide in 2013 may be attributable to a fruit and vegetable
              intake below 500 and 800 g/day, respectively, if the observed
              associations are causal. Conclusions: Fruit and vegetable intakes
              were associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease,
              cancer and all-cause mortality. These results support public
              health recommendations to increase fruit and vegetable intake for
              the prevention of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and premature

               Data synthesis Random effects models were used to calculate
               pooled hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals and to
               incorporate variation between studies. The linear and non-linear
               dose-response relations were evaluated with data from categories
               of fruit and vegetable consumption in each study. Results
               Sixteen prospective cohort studies were eligible in this
               meta-analysis. During follow-up periods ranging from 4.6 to 26
               years there were 56 423 deaths (11 512 from cardiovascular
               disease and 16 817 from cancer) among 833 234 participants.
               Higher consumption of fruit and vegetables was significantly
               associated with a lower risk of all cause mortality. Pooled
               hazard ratios of all cause mortality were 0.95 (95\% confidence
               interval 0.92 to 0.98) for an increment of one serving a day of
               fruit and vegetables (P=0.001), 0.94 (0.90 to 0.98) for fruit
               (P=0.002), and 0.95 (0.92 to 0.99) for vegetables (P=0.006).
               There was a threshold around five servings of fruit and
               vegetables a day, after which the risk of all cause mortality
               did not reduce further. A significant inverse association was
               observed for cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio for each
               additional serving a day of fruit and vegetables 0.96, 95\%
               confidence interval 0.92 to 0.99), while higher consumption of
               fruit and vegetables was not appreciably associated with risk of
               cancer mortality. Conclusions This meta-analysis provides
               further evidence that a higher consumption of fruit and
               vegetables is associated with a lower risk of all cause
               mortality, particularly cardiovascular mortality.",

                 incidence of cardiovascular disease and cancer and of deaths
                 from other causes in two prospective cohorts. METHODS: A total
                 of 71 910 female participants in the Nurses' Health study and
                 37,725 male participants in the Health Professionals'
                 Follow-up Study who were free of major chronic disease
                 completed baseline semiquantitative food-frequency
                 questionnaires in 1984 and 1986, respectively. Dietary
                 information was updated in 1986, 1990, and 1994 for women and
                 in 1990 and 1994 for men. Participants were followed up for
                 incidence of cardiovascular disease, cancer, or death through
                 May 1998 (women) and January 1998 (men).
                 Multivariable-adjusted relative risks were calculated with Cox
                 proportional hazards analysis. RESULTS: We ascertained 9329
                 events (1964 cardiovascular, 6584 cancer, and 781 other
                 deaths) in women and 4957 events (1670 cardiovascular
                 diseases, 2500 cancers, and 787 other deaths) in men during
                 follow-up. For men and women combined, participants in the
                 highest quintile of total fruit and vegetable intake had a
                 relative risk for major chronic disease of 0.95 (95\%
                 confidence interval [CI] = 0.89 to 1.01) times that of those
                 in the lowest. Total fruit and vegetable intake was inversely
                 associated with risk of cardiovascular disease but not with
                 overall cancer incidence, with relative risk for an increment
                 of five servings daily of 0.88 (95\% CI = 0.81 to 0.95) for
                 cardiovascular disease and 1.00 (95\% CI = 0.95 to 1.05) for
                 cancer. Of the food groups analyzed, green leafy vegetable
                 intake showed the strongest inverse association with major
                 chronic disease and cardiovascular disease. For an increment
                 of one serving per day of green leafy vegetables, relative
                 risks were 0.95 (95\% CI = 0.92 to 0.99) for major chronic
                 disease and 0.89 (95\% CI = 0.83 to 0.96) for cardiovascular
                 disease. CONCLUSIONS: Increased fruit and vegetable
                 consumption was associated with a modest although not
                 statistically significant reduction in the development of
                 major chronic disease. The benefits appeared to be primarily

                 (HR) for death adjusted for multiple covariates were estimated

                 mortality. Among the nonvitamin-nonmineral supplements, only
                 glucosamine and chondroitin were associated with total
                 mortality. The hazard ratio (HR) when persons with a high
                 intake of supplements (> or =4 d/wk for > or =3 y) were
                 compared with nonusers was 0.83 (95\% CI: 0.72, 0.97; P for
                 trend = 0.009) for glucosamine and 0.83 (95\% CI: 0.69, 1.00;
                 P for trend = 0.011) for chondroitin. There was also a
                 suggestion of a decreased risk of total mortality associated
                 with a high intake of fish-oil supplements (HR: 0.83; 95\% CI:
                 0.70, 1.00), but the test for trend was not statistically
                 significant. CONCLUSIONS: For most of the supplements we
                 examined, there was no association with total mortality. Use
                 of glucosamine and use of chondroitin were each associated
                 with decreased total mortality.",

                 Gompertz coefficients, known as the SM correlation. While the
                 SM correlation is supported by data from developed countries

                   an important molecular mechanism of aging, a quantitative
                   link between the dynamics of damage accumulation and
                   mortality of species has so far remained elusive. To address
                   this question, we examine stability properties of a generic
                   gene regulatory network (GRN) and demonstrate that many
                   characteristics of aging and the associated population
                   mortality rate emerge as inherent properties of the critical
                   dynamics of gene regulation and metabolic levels. Based on
                   the analysis of age-dependent changes in gene-expression and
                   metabolic profiles in Drosophila melanogaster, we explicitly
                   show that the underlying GRNs are nearly critical and
                   inherently unstable. This instability manifests itself as
                   aging in the form of distortion of gene expression and
                   metabolic profiles with age, and causes the characteristic
                   increase in mortality rate with age as described by a form
                   of the Gompertz law. In addition, we explain late-life
                   mortality deceleration observed at very late ages for large
                   populations. We show that aging contains a stochastic
                   component, related to accumulation of regulatory errors in
                   transcription/translation/metabolic pathways due to
                   imperfection of signaling cascades in the network and of
                   responses to environmental factors. We also establish that
                   there is a strong deterministic component, suggesting
                   genetic control. Since mortality in humans, where it is
                   characterized best, is strongly associated with the
                   incidence of age-related diseases, our findings support the
                   idea that aging is the driving force behind the development

              Gompertz fit",
  author   = "Tarkhov, Andrei E and Menshikov, Leonid I and Fedichev, Peter O",
  abstract = "Gompertz empirical law of mortality is often used in practical
              research to parametrize survival fraction as a function of age
              with the help of just two quantities: the Initial Mortality Rate
              (IMR) and the Gompertz exponent, inversely proportional to the
              Mortality Rate Doubling Time (MRDT). The IMR is often found to be
              inversely related to the Gompertz exponent, which is the
              dependence commonly referred to as Strehler-Mildvan (SM)
              correlation. In this paper, we address fundamental uncertainties
              of the Gompertz parameters inference from experimental
              Kaplan-Meier plots and show, that a least squares fit often leads
              to an ill-defined non-linear optimization problem, which is
              extremely sensitive to sampling errors and the smallest
              systematic demographic variations. Therefore, an analysis of
              consequent repeats of the same experiments in the same biological
              conditions yields the whole degenerate manifold of possible
              Gompertz parameters. We find that whenever the average lifespan
              of species greatly exceeds MRDT, small random variations in the
              survival records produce large deviations in the identified
              Gompertz parameters along the line, corresponding to the set of
              all possible IMR and MRDT values, roughly compatible with the
              properly determined value of average lifespan in experiment. The
              best fit parameters in this case turn out to be related by a form
              of SM correlation. Therefore, we have to conclude that the
              combined property, such as the average lifespan in the group,
              rather than IMR and MRDT values separately, may often only be
              reliably determined via experiments, even in a perfectly
              homogeneous animal cohort due to its finite size and/or low
              age-sampling frequency, typical for modern high-throughput
              settings. We support our findings with careful analysis of
              experimental survival records obtained in cohorts of C. elegans
              of different sizes, in control groups and under the influence of
              experimental therapies or environmental conditions. We argue that
              since, SM correlation may show up as a consequence of the fitting
              degeneracy, its appearance is not limited to homogeneous cohorts.
              In fact, the problem persists even beyond the simple Gompertz
              mortality law. We show that the same degeneracy occurs exactly in
              the same way, if a more advanced Gompertz-Makeham aging model is
              employed to improve the modeling. We explain how SM type of
              relation between the demographic parameters may still be observed
              even in extremely large cohorts with immense statistical power,
              such as in human census datasets, provided that systematic
              historical changes are weak in nature and lead to a gradual
              change in the mean lifespan.",

                 medical interventions that would greatly increase the maximum
                 healthy human lifespan. Much of this literature has emphasised
                 the current non-existence of any such therapies, and has done
                 so with laudable accuracy and authority. Regrettably, however,
                 such articles have frequently extended their ambit to include
                 the issues of how soon such interventions could be developed
                 and of how advisable such an effort would be anyway, and have
                 addressed these much more weakly, thereby diminishing the
                 force of their main message. Here a survey is made of the more
                 conspicuously flawed arguments suggesting tremendous
                 difficulties or dangers in developing such interventions, with
                 the aim thereby to tow those arguments firmly out into the
                 ocean and give them the decent but unambiguous public burial
                 that they so richly deserve. It is hoped that, by clearing the
                 debate on future anti-aging advances of these obfuscations,
                 the many aspects of this topic that have hitherto received

  abstract    = "The mitochondrial free radical theory of aging is seriously
                 challenged by the finding that mutant mtDNA never becomes
                 abundant in vivo, a result disputed only in experiments using
                 novel PCR variants whose quantitative accuracy is widely
                 doubted. However, evidence continues to mount that
                 mitochondria are the crucial site of free radical damage in
                 vivo, most notably that mice lacking the nonmitochondrial
                 isoforms of superoxide dismutase are healthy. It is thus
                 important to determine whether a low level of mutant mtDNA
                 could have serious systemic effects. This possibility exists
                 because of the observed mosaic distribution of mutant mtDNA:
                 some cells (or muscle fiber segments) lack any aerobic
                 respiration. Such cells are presumed to satisfy their ATP
                 needs by glycolysis. In vitro, however, NADH recycling by
                 transmembrane pyruvate/lactate exchange does not suffice:
                 cells only survive if they can up-regulate the plasma membrane
                 oxidoreductase (PMOR). The PMOR's physiological electron
                 acceptor is unknown. It was proposed recently (de Grey, A. D.
                 N. J. (1998) J. Anti-Aging Med. 1(1), 53-66) that a prominent
                 in vivo acceptor from these mitochondrially mutant cells may
                 be oxygen, forming extracellular superoxide. The mosaic
                 (``hotspot'') distribution of this superoxide would limit its
                 dismutation by extracellular superoxide dismutase; it may thus
                 reduce transition metals leading to oxidation of circulating
                 material, such as LDL. This would raise systemic oxidative
                 stress, greatly amplifying the damage done by the originating
                 mitochondrially mutant cells. This model, now known as the
                 ``reductive hotspot hypothesis,'' has recently gained much
                 indirect experimental support; several direct tests of it are
                 also feasible.",

  abstract  = "MUST WE AGE? A long life in a healthy, vigorous, youthful body
               has always been one of humanity's greatest dreams. Recent
               progress in genetic manipulations and calorie-restricted diets
               in laboratory animals hold forth the promise that someday
               science will enable us to exert total control over our own
               biological aging. Nearly all scientists who study the biology of
               aging agree that we will someday be able to substantially slow
               down the aging process, extending our productive, youthful
               lives. Dr. Aubrey de Grey is perhaps the most bullish of all
               such researchers. As has been reported in media outlets ranging
               from 60 Minutes to The New York Times, Dr. de Grey believes that
               the key biomedical technology required to eliminate
               aging-derived debilitation and death entirely---technology that
               would not only slow but periodically reverse age-related
               physiological decay, leaving us biologically young into an
               indefinite future---is now within reach.In Ending Aging, Dr. de
               Grey and his research assistant Michael Rae describe the details
               of this biotechnology. They explain that the aging of the human
               body, just like the aging of man-made machines, results from an
               accumulation of various types of damage. As with man-made
               machines, this damage can periodically be repaired, leading to
               indefinite extension of the machine's fully functional lifetime,
               just as is routinely done with classic cars. We already know
               what types of damage accumulate in the human body, and we are
               moving rapidly toward the comprehensive development of
               technologies to remove that damage. By demystifying aging and
               its postponement for the nonspecialist reader, de Grey and Rae
               systematically dismantle the fatalist presumption that aging
               will forever defeat the efforts of medical science.",

  abstract    = "Over recent years, evidence has been accumulating in favour of
                 the free radical theory of aging, first proposed by Harman.
                 Despite this, an understanding of the mechanism by which cells
                 might succumb to the effects of free radicals has proved
                 elusive. This paper proposes such a mechanism, based on a
                 previously unexplored hypothesis for the proliferation of
                 mutant mitochondrial DNA: that mitochondria with reduced
                 respiratory function, due to a mutation or deletion affecting
                 the respiratory chain, suffer less frequent lysosomal
                 degradation, because they inflict free radical damage more
                 slowly on their own membranes. Once such a mutation occurs in
                 a mitochondrion of a non-dividing cell, therefore,
                 mitochondria carrying it will rapidly populate that cell,
                 thereby destroying the cell's respiratory capability. The
                 accumulation of cells that have undergone this transition
                 results in aging at the organismal level. The consistency of
                 the hypothesis with known facts is discussed, and technically
                 feasible tests are suggested, of both the proposed mechanism
                 and its overall contribution to mammalian aging.",

                 priors. We conducted a simulation study to assess the
                 performance of informative normal, Student-t, and beta
                 distributions in estimating relative risk (RR) or odds ratio

                 95\% credible intervals. Simulation results show that the

              small chances for success can be sufficient to make opting for

              Framingham Heart Study with comparable significant effects, and
              an additional three signatures showed consistent effects. This
              analysis shows that various biomarker signatures exist, and their
              significant associations with physical function, morbidity, and
              mortality suggest that these patterns represent differences in
              biological aging. The signatures show that dysregulation of a
              single biomarker can change with patterns of other biomarkers,
              and age-related changes of individual biomarkers alone do not
              necessarily indicate disease or functional decline.",

              populations is critical. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association
              between dietary patterns in midlife and prevalence of healthy
              aging. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING:
              Nurses' Health Study. PARTICIPANTS: 10 670 women with dietary
              data and no major chronic diseases between 1984 and 1986, when
              they were in their late 50s and early 60s (median age, 59 years).
              Women provided information on health an average of 15 years
              later. MEASUREMENTS: Diet quality in midlife was ascertained
              using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHEI-2010) and
              Alternate Mediterranean diet scores, averaged from 2
              food-frequency questionnaires (1984 to 1986). ``Healthy'' aging
              was defined as survival to 70 years or older with maintenance of
              4 health domains: no major chronic diseases or major impairments
              in cognitive or physical function or mental health. RESULTS:
              After multivariable adjustment, greater adherence to the
              AHEI-2010 (upper vs. lower quintiles) in midlife was related to
              34\% (95\% CI, 9\% to 66\%; P for trend < 0.001) greater odds of
              healthy versus usual aging. Greater adherence to Alternate
              Mediterranean diet was related to 46\% (CI, 17\% to 83\%; P for
              trend = 0.002) greater odds of healthy aging. When the 4
              components of healthy aging were analyzed separately, the
              AHEI-2010 and Alternate Mediterranean diet were significantly
              associated with greater likelihood of no major limitations in
              physical function and mental health. LIMITATIONS: Residual
              confounding was possible, although many confounding factors were
              considered. Bias due to complex patterns of measurement error
              within diet scores cannot be excluded. CONCLUSION: Better diet
              quality at midlife seems to be strongly linked to greater health
              and well-being in persons surviving to older ages. PRIMARY

                 study was to evaluate the predictive power of aerobic capacity
                 for mortality in middle-aged men during 45-years of follow-up.
                 DESIGN: The study design was a population-based prospective
                 cohort study. METHODS: A representative sample from Gothenburg
                 of men born in 1913 was followed from 50-99 years of age, with
                 periodic medical examinations and data from the National
                 Hospital Discharge and Cause of Death registers. At 54 years
                 of age, 792 men performed an ergometer exercise test, with 656
                 (83\%) performing the maximum exercise test. RESULTS: In Cox
                 regression analysis, low predicted peak oxygen uptake
                 ([Formula: see text]), smoking, high serum cholesterol and
                 high mean arterial blood pressure at rest were significantly
                 associated with mortality. In multivariable analysis, an
                 association was found between predicted [Formula: see text]
                 tertiles and mortality, independent of established risk
                 factors. Hazard ratios were 0.79 (95\% confidence interval
                 (CI) 0.71-0.89; p < 0.0001) for predicted [Formula: see text],
                 1.01 (1.002-1.02; p < 0.01) for mean arterial blood pressure,
                 1.13 (1.04-1.22; p < 0.005) for cholesterol, and 1.58
                 (1.34-1.85; p < 0.0001) for smoking. The variable impact
                 (Wald's $\chi$(2)) of predicted [Formula: see text] tertiles
                 (15.3) on mortality was secondary only to smoking (31.4). The
                 risk associated with low predicted [Formula: see text] was

                 smoking, blood pressure and serum cholesterol, during more

  abstract    = "The structure of the post-mortem human brain can be preserved
                 by immersing the organ within a fixative solution. Once the
                 brain is perfused, cellular and histological features are
                 maintained over extended periods of time. However, functions
                 of the human brain are not assumed to be preserved beyond
                 death and subsequent chemical fixation. Here we present a
                 series of experiments which, together, refute this assumption.
                 Instead, we suggest that chemical preservation of brain
                 structure results in some retained functional capacity.
                 Patterns similar to the living condition were elicited by
                 chemical and electrical probes within coronal and sagittal
                 sections of human temporal lobe structures that had been
                 maintained in ethanol-formalin-acetic acid. This was inferred
                 by a reliable modulation of frequency-dependent microvolt
                 fluctuations. These weak microvolt fluctuations were enhanced
                 by receptor-specific agonists and their precursors (i.e.,
                 nicotine, 5-HTP, and L-glutamic acid) as well as attenuated by
                 receptor-antagonists (i.e., ketamine). Surface injections of
                 10 nM nicotine enhanced theta power within the right
                 parahippocampal gyrus without any effect upon the ipsilateral
                 hippocampus. Glutamate-induced high-frequency power densities
                 within the left parahippocampal gyrus were correlated with
                 increased photon counts over the surface of the tissue.
                 Heschl's gyrus, a transverse convexity on which the primary
                 auditory cortex is tonotopically represented, retained
                 frequency-discrimination capacities in response to sweeps of
                 weak (2$\mu$V) square-wave electrical pulses between 20 Hz and
                 20 kHz. Together, these results suggest that portions of the
                 post-mortem human brain may retain latent capacities to
                 respond with potential life-like and virtual properties.",

                 all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality risk in a
                 large pooled Scottish and English population-based cohort.
                 METHODS: Cox proportional hazards regression was used to
                 investigate the associations between each exposure and
                 all-cause and CVD mortality with adjustment for potential
                 confounders in 80 306 individuals (54\% women; mean$\pm$SD
                 age: 52$\pm$14 years). RESULTS: Significant reductions in
                 all-cause mortality were observed for participation in cycling

                 associations were found for participation in football and
                 running. A significant reduction in CVD mortality was observed
                 for participation in swimming (HR=0.59, 95\% CI 0.46 to 0.75),
                 racquet sports (HR=0.44, 95\% CI 0.24 to 0.83) and aerobics

                 dose-response patterns between the exposure and the outcomes

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Aspirin has been shown to lower the incidence and
                 the mortality of vascular disease and cancer but its wider
                 adoption appears to be seriously impeded by concerns about
                 gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Unlike heart attacks, stroke
                 and cancer, GI bleeding is an acute event, usually followed by
                 complete recovery. We propose therefore that a more
                 appropriate evaluation of the risk-benefit balance would be
                 based on fatal adverse events, rather than on the incidence of
                 bleeding. We therefore present a literature search and
                 meta-analysis to ascertain fatal events attributable to
                 low-dose aspirin. METHODS: In a systematic literature review
                 we identified reports of randomised controlled trials of
                 aspirin in which both total GI bleeding events and bleeds that
                 led to death had been reported. Principal investigators of
                 studies in which fatal events had not been adequately
                 described were contacted via email and asked for further
                 details. A meta-analyses was then performed to estimate the
                 risk of fatal gastrointestinal bleeding attributable to
                 low-dose aspirin. RESULTS: Eleven randomised trials were
                 identified in the literature search. In these the relative
                 risk (RR) of 'major' incident GI bleeding in subjects who had
                 been randomised to low-dose aspirin was 1.55 (95\% CI 1.33,
                 1.83), and the risk of a bleed attributable to aspirin being
                 fatal was 0.45 (95\% CI 0.25, 0.80). In all the subjects
                 randomised to aspirin, compared with those randomised not to
                 receive aspirin, there was no significant increase in the risk
                 of a fatal bleed (RR 0.77; 95\% CI 0.41, 1.43). CONCLUSIONS:
                 The majority of the adverse events caused by aspirin are GI
                 bleeds, and there appears to be no valid evidence that the
                 overall frequency of fatal GI bleeds is increased by aspirin.
                 The substantive risk for prophylactic aspirin is therefore
                 cerebral haemorrhage which can be fatal or severely disabling,
                 with an estimated risk of one death and one disabling stroke
                 for every 1,000 people taking aspirin for ten years. These
                 adverse effects of aspirin should be weighed against the
                 reductions in vascular disease and cancer.",

  abstract    = "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) often exists in a state of
                 heteroplasmy, in which mutant mtDNA co-exists in cells with
                 wild-type mtDNA. High frequencies of pathogenic mtDNA result
                 in maternally inherited diseases; maternally and somatically
                 acquired mutations also accumulate over time and contribute to
                 diseases of ageing. Reducing heteroplasmy is therefore a
                 therapeutic goal and in vivo models in post-mitotic tissues
                 are needed to facilitate these studies. Here we describe a
                 transgene-based model of a heteroplasmic lethal mtDNA deletion
                 (mtDNA($\Delta$)) in adult Drosophila muscle. Stimulation of
                 autophagy, activation of the PINK1/parkin pathway or decreased
                 levels of mitofusin result in a selective decrease in
                 mtDNA($\Delta$). Decreased levels of mitofusin and increased
                 levels of ATPIF1, an inhibitor of ATP synthase
                 reversal-dependent mitochondrial repolarization, result in a
                 further decrease in mtDNA($\Delta$) levels. These results show
                 that an adult post-mitotic tissue can be cleansed of a
                 deleterious genome, suggesting that therapeutic removal of
                 mutant mtDNA can be achieved.",

                 impairments, making it important to elucidate a means to
                 combat the effects of aging. Here we report that exposure of
                 an aged animal to young blood can counteract and reverse
                 pre-existing effects of brain aging at the molecular,
                 structural, functional and cognitive level. Genome-wide
                 microarray analysis of heterochronic parabionts--in which
                 circulatory systems of young and aged animals are
                 connected--identified synaptic plasticity-related
                 transcriptional changes in the hippocampus of aged mice.
                 Dendritic spine density of mature neurons increased and
                 synaptic plasticity improved in the hippocampus of aged
                 heterochronic parabionts. At the cognitive level, systemic
                 administration of young blood plasma into aged mice improved
                 age-related cognitive impairments in both contextual fear

                 cognitive enhancements elicited by exposure to young blood are
                 mediated, in part, by activation of the cyclic AMP response
                 element binding protein (Creb) in the aged hippocampus. Our
                 data indicate that exposure of aged mice to young blood late

              remains unclear. We conducted a dose-response meta-analysis of
              prospective studies to examine the dose-response associations
              between coffee consumption and mortality from all causes,
              cardiovascular disease (CVD), and all cancers. Pertinent studies,
              published between 1966 and 2013, were identified by searching
              PubMed and by reviewing the reference lists of the selected
              articles. Prospective studies in which investigators reported
              relative risks of mortality from all causes, CVD, and all cancers
              for 3 or more categories of coffee consumption were eligible.
              Results from individual studies were pooled using a
              random-effects model. Twenty-one prospective studies, with
              121,915 deaths and 997,464 participants, met the inclusion
              criteria. There was strong evidence of nonlinear associations
              between coffee consumption and mortality for all causes and CVD
              (P for nonlinearity < 0.001). The largest risk reductions were
              observed for 4 cups/day for all-cause mortality (16\%, 95\%
              confidence interval: 13, 18) and 3 cups/day for CVD mortality
              (21\%, 95\% confidence interval: 16, 26). Coffee consumption was

  abstract    = "Coffee, after water, is the most widely consumed beverage in
                 the United States, and is the principal source of caffeine
                 intake among adults. The biological effects of coffee may be
                 substantial and are not limited to the actions of caffeine.
                 Coffee is a complex beverage containing hundreds of
                 biologically active compounds, and the health effects of
                 chronic coffee intake are wide ranging. From a cardiovascular
                 (CV) standpoint, coffee consumption may reduce the risk of
                 type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, as well as other
                 conditions associated with CV risk such as obesity and
                 depression; but it may adversely affect lipid profiles
                 depending on how the beverage is prepared. Regardless, a
                 growing body of data suggests that habitual coffee consumption
                 is neutral to beneficial regarding the risks of a variety of
                 adverse CV outcomes including coronary heart disease,
                 congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, and stroke. Moreover,
                 large epidemiological studies suggest that regular coffee
                 drinkers have reduced risks of mortality, both CV and
                 all-cause. The potential benefits also include protection
                 against neurodegenerative diseases, improved asthma control,
                 and lower risk of select gastrointestinal diseases. A daily
                 intake of ∼2 to 3 cups of coffee appears to be safe and is
                 associated with neutral to beneficial effects for most of the
                 studied health outcomes. However, most of the data on coffee's
                 health effects are based on observational data, with very few
                 randomized, controlled studies, and association does not prove
                 causation. Additionally, the possible advantages of regular
                 coffee consumption have to be weighed against potential risks
                 (which are mostly related to its high caffeine content)
                 including anxiety, insomnia, tremulousness, and palpitations,

                 especially in relation to nervous system pathologies and
                 aging. The vitamin D(3) endocrine system consists of 3 active
                 calcipherol hormones: calcidiol (25OHD(3)), 1alpha-calcitriol
                 (1alpha,25(OH)2D(3)) and 24-calcitriol (24,25(OH)2D(3)). The
                 impact of the calcipherol hormone system on aging, health and
                 disease is discussed. Low serum calcidiol concentrations are
                 associated with an increased risk of several chronic diseases
                 including osteoporosis, cancer, diabetes, autoimmune
                 disorders, hypertension, atherosclerosis and muscle weakness
                 all of which can be considered aging-related diseases. The

                 Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, seasonal affective

                 CNS. Overall, imbalances in the calcipherol system appear to

  abstract    = "Recent studies using genetically modified mice, such as
                 FGF23-/- and Klotho-/- mice that exhibit altered mineral
                 homeostasis due to a high vitamin D activity showed features
                 of premature aging that include retarded growth, osteoporosis,
                 atherosclerosis, ectopic calcification, immunological
                 deficiency, skin and general organ atrophy, hypogonadism and
                 short lifespan. The phenotype reversed by normalizing vitamin
                 D and/or mineral homeostasis. Thus, hypervitaminosis D due to
                 an increased 1alpha-hydroxylase activity seems to be a cause
                 of the premature aging. In several studies, we have described
                 that a complete or partial lack of vitamin D action (VDR-/-
                 mice and CYP27B1-/-) show almost similar phenotype as FGF23-/-
                 or Klotho-/- mice. VDR mutant mice have growth retardation,
                 osteoporosis, kyphosis, skin thickening and wrinkling,
                 alopecia, ectopic calcification, progressive loss of hearing
                 and balance as well as short lifespan. CYP27B1-/- mice do not
                 show alopecia nor balance deficit, which might be
                 apoVDR-dependent or calcidiol-dependent. The features are
                 typical to premature aging. The phenotype is resistant to a
                 normalization of the mineral homeostasis by a rescue diet
                 containing high calcium and phosphate. Taken together, aging
                 shows a U-shaped dependency on hormonal forms of vitamin D
                 suggesting that there is an optimal concentration of vitamin D
                 in delaying aging phenomena. Our recent study shows that
                 calcidiol is an active hormone. Since serum calcidiol but not
                 calcitriol is fluctuating in physiological situations,
                 calcidiol might determine the biological output of vitamin D
                 action. Due to its high serum concentration and better uptake
                 of calcidiol-DBP by the target cells through the
                 cubilin-megalin system, calcidiol seems to be an important
                 circulating hormone. Therefore, serum calcidiol might be
                 associated with an increased risk of aging-related chronic
                 diseases more directly than calcitriol. Aging and cancer seem
                 to be tightly associated phenomena. Accumulation of damage on
                 DNA and telomeres cause both aging and cancer, moreover the
                 signalling pathways seem to converge on tumour suppressor
                 protein, p53, which seems to be regulated by vitamin D. Also,
                 the insulin-like growth factor signalling pathway (IGF-1,
                 IGFBPs, IGFR) and fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23)
                 regulate growth, aging and cancer. Vitamin D can regulate
                 these signalling pathways, too. Also NF-kappaB and telomerase
                 reverse transcriptase (TERT) might be molecular mechanisms
                 mediating vitamin D action in aging and cancer. Calcidiol
                 serum concentrations show a U-shaped risk of prostate cancer
                 suggesting an optimal serum concentration of 40-60 nmol/L for
                 the lowest cancer risk. Therefore, it is necessary to study
                 several common aging-associated diseases such as osteoporosis,
                 hypertension and diabetes known to be vitamin D-dependent
                 before any recommendations of an optimal serum concentration
                 of calcidiol are given.",

  abstract    = "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between serum
                 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations (25(OH)D) and mortality in
                 a large consortium of cohort studies paying particular
                 attention to potential age, sex, season, and country
                 differences. DESIGN: Meta-analysis of individual participant
                 data of eight prospective cohort studies from Europe and the
                 US. SETTING: General population. PARTICIPANTS: 26,018 men and
                 women aged 50-79 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All-cause,
                 cardiovascular, and cancer mortality. RESULTS: 25(OH)D
                 concentrations varied strongly by season (higher in summer),
                 country (higher in US and northern Europe) and sex (higher in
                 men), but no consistent trend with age was observed. During
                 follow-up, 6695 study participants died, among whom 2624 died
                 of cardiovascular diseases and 2227 died of cancer. For each
                 cohort and analysis, 25(OH)D quintiles were defined with
                 cohort and subgroup specific cut-off values. Comparing bottom
                 versus top quintiles resulted in a pooled risk ratio of 1.57
                 (95\% CI 1.36 to 1.81) for all-cause mortality. Risk ratios
                 for cardiovascular mortality were similar in magnitude to that
                 for all-cause mortality in subjects both with and without a
                 history of cardiovascular disease at baseline. With respect to
                 cancer mortality, an association was only observed among
                 subjects with a history of cancer (risk ratio, 1.70 (1.00 to
                 2.88)). Analyses using all quintiles suggest curvilinear,
                 inverse, dose-response curves for the aforementioned
                 relationships. No strong age, sex, season, or country specific
                 differences were detected. Heterogeneity was low in most
                 meta-analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Despite levels of 25(OH)D strongly
                 varying with country, sex, and season, the association between
                 25(OH)D level and all-cause and cause-specific mortality was
                 remarkably consistent. Results from a long term randomised
                 controlled trial addressing longevity are being awaited before
                 vitamin D supplementation can be recommended in most
                 individuals with low 25(OH)D levels.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Vitamin D insufficiency is associated with many
                 disorders, leading to calls for widespread supplementation.
                 Some investigators suggest that more clinical trials to test
                 the effect of vitamin D on disorders are needed. METHODS: We
                 did a trial sequential meta-analysis of existing randomised
                 controlled trials of vitamin D supplements, with or without
                 calcium, to investigate the possible effect of future trials
                 on current knowledge. We estimated the effects of vitamin D
                 supplementation on myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart
                 disease, stroke or cerebrovascular disease, cancer, total
                 fracture, hip fracture, and mortality in trial sequential
                 analyses using a risk reduction threshold of 5\% for mortality
                 and 15\% for other endpoints. FINDINGS: The effect estimate
                 for vitamin D supplementation with or without calcium for
                 myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease (nine trials,
                 48 647 patients), stroke or cerebrovascular disease (eight
                 trials 46 431 patients), cancer (seven trials, 48 167
                 patients), and total fracture (22 trials, 76 497 patients) lay
                 within the futility boundary, indicating that vitamin D
                 supplementation does not alter the relative risk of any of
                 these endpoints by 15\% or more. Vitamin D supplementation
                 alone did not reduce hip fracture by 15\% or more (12 trials,
                 27 834 patients). Vitamin D co-administered with calcium
                 reduced hip fracture in institutionalised individuals (two
                 trials, 3853 patients) but did not alter the relative risk of
                 hip fracture by 15\% or more in community-dwelling individuals
                 (seven trials, 46 237 patients). There is uncertainty as to
                 whether vitamin D with or without calcium reduces the risk of
                 death (38 trials, 81 173). INTERPRETATION: Our findings
                 suggest that vitamin D supplementation with or without calcium
                 does not reduce skeletal or non-skeletal outcomes in
                 unselected community-dwelling individuals by more than 15\%.
                 Future trials with similar designs are unlikely to alter these
                 conclusions. FUNDING: Health Research Council of New Zealand.",

                 been associated with many non-skeletal disorders. However,
                 whether low 25(OH)D is the cause or result of ill health is
                 not known. We did a systematic search of prospective and
                 intervention studies that assessed the effect of 25(OH)D
                 concentrations on non-skeletal health outcomes in individuals
                 aged 18 years or older. We identified 290 prospective cohort
                 studies (279 on disease occurrence or mortality, and 11 on
                 cancer characteristics or survival), and 172 randomised trials
                 of major health outcomes and of physiological parameters
                 related to disease risk or inflammatory status. Investigators
                 of most prospective studies reported moderate to strong
                 inverse associations between 25(OH)D concentrations and
                 cardiovascular diseases, serum lipid concentrations,
                 inflammation, glucose metabolism disorders, weight gain,
                 infectious diseases, multiple sclerosis, mood disorders,
                 declining cognitive function, impaired physical functioning,
                 and all-cause mortality. High 25(OH)D concentrations were not
                 associated with a lower risk of cancer, except colorectal
                 cancer. Results from intervention studies did not show an
                 effect of vitamin D supplementation on disease occurrence,
                 including colorectal cancer. In 34 intervention studies
                 including 2805 individuals with mean 25(OH)D concentration
                 lower than 50 nmol/L at baseline supplementation with 50
                 $\mu$g per day or more did not show better results.
                 Supplementation in elderly people (mainly women) with 20
                 $\mu$g vitamin D per day seemed to slightly reduce all-cause
                 mortality. The discrepancy between observational and
                 intervention studies suggests that low 25(OH)D is a marker of
                 ill health. Inflammatory processes involved in disease
                 occurrence and clinical course would reduce 25(OH)D, which
                 would explain why low vitamin D status is reported in a wide
                 range of disorders. In elderly people, restoration of vitamin
                 D deficits due to ageing and lifestyle changes induced by ill
                 health could explain why low-dose supplementation leads to
                 slight gains in survival.",

               systematic review updates and reassesses the benefits and harms
               of vitamin D supplementation used in primary and secondary
               prophylaxis of mortality. Objectives Objectives To assess the
               beneficial and harmful effects of vitamin D supplementation for
               prevention of mortality in healthy adults and adults in a stable
               phase of disease. Search methods Search methods We searched The
               Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, the Science Citation
               Index--Expanded and Conference Proceedings Citation
               Index--Science (all up to February 2012). We checked references
               of included trials and pharmaceutical companies for unidentified
               relevant trials. Selection criteria Selection criteria
               Randomised trials that compared any type of vitamin D in any
               dose with any duration and route of administration versus
               placebo or no intervention in adult participants. Participants
               could have been recruited from the general population or from
               patients diagnosed with a disease in a stable phase. Vitamin D
               could have been administered as supplemental vitamin D (vitamin
               D3 (cholecalciferol) or vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol)) or as an
               active form of vitamin D (1$\alpha$-hydroxyvitamin D
               (alfacalcidol) or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol)). Data
               collection and analysis Data collection and analysis Six review
               authors extracted data independently. Random-effects and
               fixed-effect meta-analyses were conducted. For dichotomous
               outcomes, we calculated the risk ratios (RRs). To account for
               trials with zero events, we performed meta-analyses of
               dichotomous data using risk differences (RDs) and empirical
               continuity corrections. We used published data and data obtained
               by contacting trial authors. To minimise the risk of systematic
               error, we assessed the risk of bias of the included trials.
               Trial sequential analyses controlled the risk of random errors
               possibly caused by cumulative meta-analyses. Main results Main
               results We identified 159 randomised clinical trials.
               Ninety-four trials reported no mortality, and nine trials
               reported mortality but did not report in which intervention
               group the mortality occurred. Accordingly, 56 randomised trials
               with 95,286 participants provided usable data on mortality. The
               age of participants ranged from 18 to 107 years. Most trials
               included women older than 70 years. The mean proportion of women
               was 77\%. Forty-eight of the trials randomly assigned 94,491
               healthy participants. Of these, four trials included healthy
               volunteers, nine trials included postmenopausal women and 35
               trials included older people living on their own or in
               institutional care. The remaining eight trials randomly assigned
               795 participants with neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory
               or rheumatoid diseases. Vitamin D was administered for a
               weighted mean of 4.4 years. More than half of the trials had a
               low risk of bias. All trials were conducted in high-income
               countries. Forty-five trials (80\%) reported the baseline
               vitamin D status of participants based on serum
               25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Participants in 19 trials had
               vitamin D adequacy (at or above 20 ng/mL). Participants in the
               remaining 26 trials had vitamin D insufficiency (less than 20
               ng/mL). Vitamin D decreased mortality in all 56 trials analysed
               together (5,920/47,472 (12.5\%) vs 6,077/47,814 (12.7\%); RR
               0.97 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 0.99); P = 0.02; I2
               = 0\%). More than 8\% of participants dropped out. 'Worst-best
               case' and 'best-worst case' scenario analyses demonstrated that
               vitamin D could be associated with a dramatic increase or
               decrease in mortality. When different forms of vitamin D were
               assessed in separate analyses, only vitamin D3 decreased
               mortality (4,153/37,817 (11.0\%) vs 4,340/38,110 (11.4\%); RR
               0.94 (95\% CI 0.91 to 0.98); P = 0.002; I2 = 0\%; 75,927
               participants; 38 trials). Vitamin D2, alfacalcidol and
               calcitriol did not significantly affect mortality. A subgroup
               analysis of trials at high risk of bias suggested that vitamin
               D2 may even increase mortality, but this finding could be due to
               random errors. Trial sequential analysis supported our finding

               Vitamin D3 statistically significantly decreased cancer
               mortality (RR 0.88 (95\% CI 0.78 to 0.98); P = 0.02; I2 = 0\%;
               44,492 participants; 4 trials). Vitamin D3 combined with calcium
               increased the risk of nephrolithiasis (RR 1.17 (95\% CI 1.02 to
               1.34); P = 0.02; I2 = 0\%; 42,876 participants; 4 trials).
               Alfacalcidol and calcitriol increased the risk of hypercalcaemia
               (RR 3.18 (95\% CI 1.17 to 8.68); P = 0.02; I2 = 17\%; 710
               participants; 3 trials). Authors' conclusions Authors'
               conclusions Vitamin D3 seemed to decrease mortality in elderly
               people living independently or in institutional care. Vitamin
               D2, alfacalcidol and calcitriol had no statistically significant
               beneficial effects on mortality. Vitamin D3 combined with
               calcium increased nephrolithiasis. Both alfacalcidol and
               calcitriol increased hypercalcaemia. Because of risks of
               attrition bias originating from substantial dropout of
               participants and of outcome reporting bias due to a number of
               trials not reporting on mortality, as well as a number of other
               weaknesses in our evidence, further placebo-controlled
               randomised trials seem warranted.",

                 of life expectancy, active life expectancy, population aging,
                 and social and medical programs tied to the size and health
                 status of the elderly population. In the past, investigators
                 have based speculations about the upper limits of human
                 longevity on observations of past trends in mortality. Here
                 the estimate of the upper bound is based on hypothesized
                 reductions in current mortality rates necessary to achieve a
                 life expectancy at birth from 80 to 120 years and an
                 expectation of life at age 50 from 30 to 70 years. With the
                 use of conditional probabilities of death from complete life
                 tables for the United States, reductions in mortality required
                 to achieve extreme longevity (that is, 80 to 120 years) were
                 compared with those resulting from hypothetical cures for all
                 cardiovascular diseases, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, and
                 cancer. Results indicate that in order for life expectancy at
                 birth to increase from present levels to what has been
                 referred to as the average biological limit to life (age 85),
                 mortality rates from all causes of death would need to decline
                 at all ages by 55\%, and at ages 50 and over by 60\%. Given
                 that hypothetical cures for major degenerative diseases would
                 reduce overall mortality by 75\%, it seems highly unlikely
                 that life expectancy at birth will exceed the age of 85.",

               increased greatly since the nineteenth century. Demographic
               evidence has revealed an ongoing reduction in old-age mortality
               and a rise of the maximum age at death, which may gradually
               extend human longevity. Together with observations that lifespan
               in various animal species is flexible and can be increased by
               genetic or pharmaceutical intervention, these results have led
               to suggestions that longevity may not be subject to strict,
               species-specific genetic constraints. Here, by analysing global
               demographic data, we show that improvements in survival with age
               tend to decline after age 100, and that the age at death of the
               world’s oldest person has not increased since the 1990s. Our

                 health and life expectancy, based on individuals' willingness
                 to pay. We then apply the framework to past and prospective
                 reductions in mortality risks, both overall and for specific
                 life-threatening diseases. We calculate (i) the social values
                 of increased longevity for men and women over the 20th
                 century; (ii) the social value of progress against various
                 diseases after 1970; and (iii) the social value of potential
                 future progress against various major categories of disease.
                 The historical gains from increased longevity have been
                 enormous. Over the 20th century, cumulative gains in life
                 expectancy were worth over $1.2 million per person for both
                 men and women. Between 1970 and 2000 increased longevity added
                 about $3.2 trillion per year to national wealth, an uncounted
                 value equal to about half of average annual GDP over the
                 period. Reduced mortality from heart disease alone has
                 increased the value of life by about $1.5 trillion per year
                 since 1970. The potential gains from future innovations in
                 health care are also extremely large. Even a modest 1 percent

  abstract = "Background: Public reporting is seen as a powerful quality
              improvement tool, but data to support its efficacy are limited.
              The Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services' Hospital Compare
              program initially reported process metrics only but started
              reporting mortality rates for acute myocardial infarction, heart
              failure, and pneumonia in 2008. Objective: To determine whether
              public reporting of mortality rates was associated with lower
              mortality rates for these conditions among Medicare
              beneficiaries. Design: For 2005 to 2007, process-only reporting
              was considered; for 2008 to 2012, process and mortality reporting
              was considered. Changes in mortality trends before and during
              reporting periods were estimated by using patient-level
              hierarchical modeling. Nonreported medical conditions were used
              as a secular control. Setting: U.S. acute care hospitals.
              Participants: 20 707 266 fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries
              hospitalized from January 2005 through November 2012.
              Measurements: 30-day risk-adjusted mortality rates. Results:
              Mortality rates for the 3 publicly reported conditions were
              changing at an absolute rate of -0.23\% per quarter during
              process-only reporting, but this change slowed to a rate of
              -0.09\% per quarter during process and mortality reporting
              (change, 0.13\% per quarter; 95\% CI, 0.12\% to 0.14\%).
              Mortality for nonreported conditions was changing at -0.17\% per
              quarter during process-only reporting and slowed slightly to
              -0.11\% per quarter during process and mortality reporting
              (change, 0.06\% per quarter; CI, 0.05\% to 0.07\%). Limitation:
              Administrative data may have limited ability to account for
              changes in patient complexity over time. Conclusion: Changes in
              mortality trends suggest that reporting in Hospital Compare was
              associated with a slowing, rather than an improvement, in the
              ongoing decline in mortality among Medicare patients. Primary

                 expectancy across areas. Results: The sample consisted of 1
                 408 287 218 person-year observations for individuals aged 40
                 to 76 years (mean age, 53.0 years; median household earnings
                 among working individuals, \$61 175 per year). There were 4
                 114 380 deaths among men (mortality rate, 596.3 per 100 000)
                 and 2 694 808 deaths among women (mortality rate, 375.1 per
                 100 000). The analysis yielded 4 results. First, higher income
                 was associated with greater longevity throughout the income
                 distribution. The gap in life expectancy between the richest
                 1\% and poorest 1\% of individuals was 14.6 years (95\% CI,
                 14.4 to 14.8 years) for men and 10.1 years (95\% CI, 9.9 to
                 10.3 years) for women. Second, inequality in life expectancy
                 increased over time. Between 2001 and 2014, life expectancy
                 increased by 2.34 years for men and 2.91 years for women in
                 the top 5\% of the income distribution, but by only 0.32 years
                 for men and 0.04 years for women in the bottom 5\% (P < .001
                 for the differences for both sexes). Third, life expectancy
                 for low-income individuals varied substantially across local
                 areas. In the bottom income quartile, life expectancy differed
                 by approximately 4.5 years between areas with the highest and
                 lowest longevity. Changes in life expectancy between 2001 and
                 2014 ranged from gains of more than 4 years to losses of more
                 than 2 years across areas. Fourth, geographic differences in
                 life expectancy for individuals in the lowest income quartile
                 were significantly correlated with health behaviors such as
                 smoking (r = -0.69, P < .001), but were not significantly
                 correlated with access to medical care, physical environmental
                 factors, income inequality, or labor market conditions. Life
                 expectancy for low-income individuals was positively
                 correlated with the local area fraction of immigrants (r =
                 0.72, P < .001), fraction of college graduates (r = 0.42, P <
                 .001), and government expenditures (r = 0.57, P < .001).
                 Conclusions and Relevance: In the United States between 2001
                 and 2014, higher income was associated with greater longevity,
                 and differences in life expectancy across income groups
                 increased over time. However, the association between life
                 expectancy and income varied substantially across areas;
                 differences in longevity across income groups decreased in
                 some areas and increased in others. The differences in life
                 expectancy were correlated with health behaviors and local
                 area characteristics.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: The quality and quantity of individuals' social
                 relationships has been linked not only to mental health but
                 also to both morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVES: This
                 meta-analytic review was conducted to determine the extent to
                 which social relationships influence risk for mortality, which
                 aspects of social relationships are most highly predictive,
                 and which factors may moderate the risk. DATA EXTRACTION: Data
                 were extracted on several participant characteristics,
                 including cause of mortality, initial health status, and
                 pre-existing health conditions, as well as on study
                 characteristics, including length of follow-up and type of
                 assessment of social relationships. RESULTS: Across 148
                 studies (308,849 participants), the random effects weighted
                 average effect size was OR = 1.50 (95\% CI 1.42 to 1.59),
                 indicating a 50\% increased likelihood of survival for
                 participants with stronger social relationships. This finding
                 remained consistent across age, sex, initial health status,
                 cause of death, and follow-up period. Significant differences
                 were found across the type of social measurement evaluated
                 (p<0.001); the association was strongest for complex measures
                 of social integration (OR = 1.91; 95\% CI 1.63 to 2.23) and
                 lowest for binary indicators of residential status (living
                 alone versus with others) (OR = 1.19; 95\% CI 0.99 to 1.44).
                 CONCLUSIONS: The influence of social relationships on risk for
                 mortality is comparable with well-established risk factors for
                 mortality. Please see later in the article for the Editors'

                 is not well established. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the
                 association between vegetarian dietary patterns and mortality.
                 DESIGN: Prospective cohort study; mortality analysis by Cox
                 proportional hazards regression, controlling for important
                 demographic and lifestyle confounders. SETTING: Adventist
                 Health Study 2 (AHS-2), a large North American cohort.
                 PARTICIPANTS: A total of 96,469 Seventh-day Adventist men and
                 women recruited between 2002 and 2007, from which an analytic
                 sample of 73,308 participants remained after exclusions.
                 EXPOSURES: Diet was assessed at baseline by a quantitative
                 food frequency questionnaire and categorized into 5 dietary
                 patterns: nonvegetarian, semi-vegetarian, pesco-vegetarian,
                 lacto-ovo-vegetarian, and vegan. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: The
                 relationship between vegetarian dietary patterns and all-cause
                 and cause-specific mortality; deaths through 2009 were
                 identified from the National Death Index. RESULTS: There were
                 2570 deaths among 73,308 participants during a mean follow-up
                 time of 5.79 years. The mortality rate was 6.05 (95\% CI,
                 5.82-6.29) deaths per 1000 person-years. The adjusted hazard
                 ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality in all vegetarians combined
                 vs nonvegetarians was 0.88 (95\% CI, 0.80-0.97). The adjusted
                 HR for all-cause mortality in vegans was 0.85 (95\% CI,
                 0.73-1.01); in lacto-ovo-vegetarians, 0.91 (95\% CI,
                 0.82-1.00); in pesco-vegetarians, 0.81 (95\% CI, 0.69-0.94);
                 and in semi-vegetarians, 0.92 (95\% CI, 0.75-1.13) compared
                 with nonvegetarians. Significant associations with vegetarian
                 diets were detected for cardiovascular mortality,
                 noncardiovascular noncancer mortality, renal mortality, and
                 endocrine mortality. Associations in men were larger and more
                 often significant than were those in women. CONCLUSIONS AND
                 RELEVANCE: Vegetarian diets are associated with lower
                 all-cause mortality and with some reductions in cause-specific
                 mortality. Results appeared to be more robust in males. These
                 favorable associations should be considered carefully by those
                 offering dietary guidance.",

  abstract = "Population turnover is necessary for progressive evolution. In
              the context of a niche with fixed carrying capacity, aging
              contributes to the rate of population turnover. Theoretically, a
              population in which death is programmed on a fixed schedule can
              evolve more rapidly than one in which population turnover is left
              to a random death rate. Could aging evolve on this basis?
              Quantitative realization of this idea is problematic, since the
              short-term individual fitness cost is likely to eliminate any
              hypothetical gene for programmed death before the long-term
              benefit can be realized. In 2011, one of us proposed the first
              quantitative model based on this mechanism that robustly evolves
              a finite, programmed life span. That model was based on a viscous
              population in a rapidly changing environment. Here, we strip this
              model to its essence and eliminate the assumption of
              environmental change. We conclude that there is no obvious way in
              which this model is unrealistic, and that it may indeed capture
              an important principle of nature’s workings. We suggest aging may
              be understood within the context of the emerging science of
              evolvability.",

                 of metformin or detrimental effects of sulphonylureas. The
                 objective of this study was therefore to compare all-cause

                 sulphonylurea or metformin monotherapy with that in matched

                 Datalink (CPRD) from 2000. Subjects with type 2 diabetes who

                 their matched controls, respectively. With reference to
                 observed survival in diabetic patients initiated with
                 metformin monotherapy [survival time ratio (STR) = 1.0],
                 adjusted median survival time was 15\% lower (STR = 0.85, 95\%
                 CI 0.81-0.90) in matched individuals without diabetes and 38\%
                 lower (0.62, 0.58-0.66) in diabetic patients treated with
                 sulphonylurea monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with type 2
                 diabetes initiated with metformin monotherapy had longer
                 survival than did matched, non-diabetic controls. Those
                 treated with sulphonylurea had markedly reduced survival
                 compared with both matched controls and those receiving
                 metformin monotherapy. This supports the position of metformin
                 as first-line therapy and implies that metformin may confer
                 benefit in non-diabetes. Sulphonylurea remains a concern.",

  abstract    = "Metformin, a biguanide drug commonly used to treat type-2
                 diabetes, has been noted to extend healthspan of nondiabetic
                 mice, but this outcome, and the molecular mechanisms that
                 underlie it, have received relatively little experimental
                 attention. To develop a genetic model for study of biguanide
                 effects on healthspan, we investigated metformin impact on
                 aging Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that metformin
                 increases nematode healthspan, slowing lipofuscin
                 accumulation, extending median lifespan, and prolonging
                 youthful locomotory ability in a dose-dependent manner.
                 Genetic data suggest that metformin acts through a mechanism
                 similar to that operative in eating-impaired dietary
                 restriction (DR) mutants, but independent of the insulin
                 signaling pathway. Energy sensor AMPK and AMPK-activating
                 kinase LKB1, which are activated in mammals by metformin
                 treatment, are essential for health benefits in C. elegans,
                 suggesting that metformin engages a metabolic loop conserved
                 across phyla. We also show that the conserved oxidative
                 stress-responsive transcription factor SKN-1/Nrf2 is essential
                 for metformin healthspan benefits in C. elegans, a mechanistic
                 requirement not previously described in mammals. skn-1, which
                 functions in nematode sensory neurons to promote DR longevity
                 benefits and in intestines for oxidative stress resistance
                 lifespan benefits, must be expressed in both neurons and
                 intestines for metformin-promoted healthspan extension,
                 supporting that metformin improves healthy middle-life aging
                 by activating both DR and antioxidant defense longevity
                 pathways. In addition to defining molecular players operative
                 in metformin healthspan benefits, our data suggest that
                 metformin may be a plausible pharmacological intervention to

                 of associations between resting heart rate and risk of
                 all-cause and cardiovascular mortality varies across studies.
                 We performed a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies to
                 quantitatively evaluate the associations in the general
                 population. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase and MEDLINE
                 from inception to Jan. 1, 2015. We used a random-effects model
                 to combine study-specific relative risks and 95\% confidence
                 intervals (CIs). We used restricted cubic spline functions to
                 assess the dose-response relation. RESULTS: A total of 46
                 studies were included in the meta-analysis, involving 1 246
                 203 patients and 78 349 deaths for all-cause mortality, and
                 848 320 patients and 25 800 deaths for cardiovascular
                 mortality. The relative risk with 10 beats/min increment of
                 resting heart rate was 1.09 (95\% CI 1.07-1.12) for all-cause
                 mortality and 1.08 (95\% CI 1.06-1.10) for cardiovascular
                 mortality. Compared with the lowest category, patients with a
                 resting heart rate of 60-80 beats/min had a relative risk of
                 1.12 (95\% CI 1.07-1.17) for all-cause mortality and 1.08
                 (95\% CI 0.99-1.17) for cardiovascular mortality, and those
                 with a resting heart rate of greater than 80 beats/min had a
                 relative risk of 1.45 (95\% CI 1.34-1.57) for all-cause
                 mortality and 1.33 (95\% CI 1.19-1.47) for cardiovascular
                 mortality. Overall, the results did not differ after
                 adjustment for traditional risk factors for cardiovascular
                 disease. Compared with 45 beats/min, the risk of all-cause
                 mortality increased significantly with increasing resting
                 heart rate in a linear relation, but a significantly increased
                 risk of cardiovascular mortality was observed at 90 beats/min.
                 Substantial heterogeneity and publication bias were detected.
                 INTERPRETATION: Higher resting heart rate was independently
                 associated with increased risks of all-cause and
                 cardiovascular mortality. This indicates that resting heart
                 rate is a predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality

                 randomized trials that assessed the effect of testosterone use
                 on cardiovascular events and risk factors in men with
                 different degrees of androgen deficiency. METHODS:
                 Librarian-designed search strategies were used to search the
                 MEDLINE (1966 to October 2004), EMBASE (1988 to October 2004),
                 and Cochrane CENTRAL (inception to October 2004) databases.
                 The database search was performed again in March 2005. We also
                 reviewed reference lists from included studies and content
                 expert files. Eligible studies were randomized trials that
                 compared any formulation of commercially available
                 testosterone with placebo and that assessed cardiovascular
                 risk factors (lipid fractions, blood pressure, blood glucose),
                 cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, nonfatal
                 myocardial infarction, angina or claudication,
                 revascularization, stroke), and cardiovascular surrogate end
                 points (ie, laboratory tests indicative of cardiac or vascular
                 disease). Using a standardized data extraction form, we
                 collected data on participants, testosterone administration,
                 and outcome measures. We assessed study quality with attention
                 to allocation concealment, blinding, and loss to follow-up.
                 RESULTS: The 30 trials included 1642 men, 808 of whom were
                 treated with testosterone. Overall, the trials had limited
                 reporting of methodological features that prevent biased
                 results (only 6 trials reported allocation concealment),
                 enrolled few patients, and were of brief duration (only 4
                 trials followed up patients for > 1 year). The median loss to
                 follow-up across all 30 trials was 9\%. Testosterone use in
                 men with low testosterone levels led to inconsequential
                 changes in blood pressure and glycemia and in all lipid
                 fractions (total cholesterol: odds ratio [OR], -0.22; 95\%
                 confidence interval [CI], -0.71 to 0.27; high-density
                 lipoprotein cholesterol: OR, -0.04; 95\% CI, -0.39 to 0.30;
                 low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: OR, 0.06; 95\% CI, -0.30
                 to 0.42; and triglycerides: OR, -0.27; 95\% CI, -0.61 to
                 0.08); results were similar in patients with low-normal to
                 normal testosterone levels. The OR between testosterone use
                 and any cardiovascular event pooled across trials that
                 reported these events (n = 6) was 1.82 (95\% CI, 0.78 to
                 4.23). Several trials failed to report data on measured
                 outcomes. For reasons we could not explain statistically, the
                 results were inconsistent across trials. CONCLUSION: Currently
                 available evidence weakly supports the inference that
                 testosterone use in men is not associated with important
                 cardiovascular effects. Patients and clinicians need large
                 randomized trials of men at risk for cardiovascular disease to
                 better inform the safety of long-term testosterone use.",

                 subgroups of subjects that did not exclude ill men, the mean
                 testosterone levels were low, and did not decline with age.
                 Subgroups that included only healthy subjects, in contrast,
                 had higher overall testosterone levels and showed a decline of

                 clinical trials to determine the risks of adverse events
                 associated with testosterone replacement in older men.
                 METHODS: The MEDLINE database was searched from 1966 to April
                 2004, using testosterone as the indexing term; limits included
                 human, male, > or =45 years old, and randomized controlled
                 trial. Of the 417 studies thus identified, 19 met the
                 inclusion criteria: testosterone replacement for at least 90
                 days, men > or =45 years old with low or low-normal
                 testosterone level, randomized controlled trial, and medically
                 stable men. Odds ratios (ORs) were pooled using a random
                 effects model, assuming heterogeneous results across studies,
                 and were weighted for sample size. RESULTS: In the 19 studies
                 that met eligibility criteria, 651 men were treated with
                 testosterone and 433 with placebo. The combined rate of all
                 prostate events was significantly greater in
                 testosterone-treated men than in placebo-treated men (OR =
                 1.78, 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-2.95). Rates of
                 prostate cancer, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >4 ng/ml, and
                 prostate biopsies were numerically higher in the testosterone
                 group than in the placebo group, although differences between
                 the groups were not individually statistically significant.
                 Testosterone-treated men were nearly four times as likely to
                 have hematocrit >50\% as placebo-treated men (OR = 3.69, 95\%
                 CI, 1.82-7.51). The frequency of cardiovascular events, sleep
                 apnea or death was not significantly different between the two
                 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Testosterone replacement in older men was
                 associated with a significantly higher risk of detection of
                 prostate events and of hematocrit >50\% than was placebo;
                 hematocrit increase was the most frequent adverse event

              in community-dwelling adults with normal body mass index (BMI) is
              not well-known. Objective: To examine total and cardiovascular
              mortality risks associated with central obesity and normal BMI.
              Design: Stratified multistage probability design. Setting: NHANES
              III (Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey).
              Participants: 15 184 adults (52.3\% women) aged 18 to 90 years.
              Measurements: Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were
              used to evaluate the relationship of obesity patterns defined by
              BMI and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and total and cardiovascular
              mortality risk after adjustment for confounding factors. Results:
              Persons with normal-weight central obesity had the worst
              long-term survival. For example, a man with a normal BMI (22
              kg/m2) and central obesity had greater total mortality risk than
              one with similar BMI but no central obesity (hazard ratio [HR],
              1.87 [95\% CI, 1.53 to 2.29]), and this man had twice the
              mortality risk of participants who were overweight or obese
              according to BMI only (HR, 2.24 [CI, 1.52 to 3.32] and 2.42 [CI,
              1.30 to 4.53], respectively). Women with normal-weight central
              obesity also had a higher mortality risk than those with similar
              BMI but no central obesity (HR, 1.48 [CI, 1.35 to 1.62]) and
              those who were obese according to BMI only (HR, 1.32 [CI, 1.15 to
              1.51]). Expected survival estimates were consistently lower for
              those with central obesity when age and BMI were controlled for.
              Limitations: Body fat distribution was assessed based on
              anthropometric indicators alone. Information on comorbidities was
              collected by self-report. Conclusion: Normal-weight central
              obesity defined by WHR is associated with higher mortality than
              BMI-defined obesity, particularly in the absence of central fat

                 DNA repair on lifespan and resistance to stress factors in
                 Drosophila melanogaster. Stress factors included hyperthermia,
                 oxidative stress, and starvation. Overexpression was either
                 constitutive or conditional and either ubiquitous or
                 tissue-specific (nervous system). Overexpressed genes included
                 those involved in recognition of DNA damage (homologs of HUS1,
                 CHK2), nucleotide and base excision repair (homologs of XPF,

                 breaks (homologs of BRCA2, XRCC3, KU80 and WRNexo). The
                 overexpression of different DNA repair genes led to both
                 positive and negative effects on lifespan and stress
                 resistance. Effects were dependent on GAL4 driver, stage of
                 induction, sex, and role of the gene in the DNA repair
                 process. While the constitutive/neuron-specific and
                 conditional/ubiquitous overexpression of DNA repair genes
                 negatively impacted lifespan and stress resistance, the
                 constitutive/ubiquitous and conditional/neuron-specific

                 called negligible senescence, i.e. they do not show signs of
                 functional decline or any increase of mortality with age.
                 Recent studies in naked mole rat and long-lived sea urchins
                 showed that these species do not alter their gene-expression
                 profiles with age as much as other organisms do. This is
                 consistent with exceptional endurance of naked mole rat
                 tissues to various genotoxic stresses. We conjectured,
                 therefore, that the lifelong transcriptional stability of an
                 organism may be a key determinant of longevity. We analyzed
                 the stability of a simple genetic-network model and found that
                 under most common circumstances, such a gene network is
                 inherently unstable. Over a time it undergoes an exponential
                 accumulation of gene-regulation deviations leading to death.
                 However, should the repair systems be sufficiently effective,
                 the gene network can stabilize so that gene damage remains
                 constrained along with mortality of the organism. We
                 investigate the relationship between stress-resistance and
                 aging and suggest that the unstable regime may provide a
                 mathematical basis for the Gompertz ``law'' of aging in many
                 species. At the same time, this model accounts for the
                 apparently age-independent mortality observed in some
                 exceptionally long-lived animals.",

                 on the nation's uniquely high rates of lack of insurance and
                 poor health outcomes relative to other high-income countries.
                 Large disparities in health outcomes are well-documented in
                 the US, but the most recent assessment of county disparities
                 in mortality is from 1999. It is critical to tracking progress
                 of health reform legislation to have an up-to-date assessment
                 of disparities in life expectancy across counties. US
                 disparities can be seen more clearly in the context of how
                 progress in each county compares to international trends.
                 METHODS: We use newly released mortality data by age, sex, and
                 county for the US from 2000 to 2007 to compute life tables
                 separately for each sex, for all races combined, for whites,
                 and for blacks. We propose, validate, and apply novel methods
                 to estimate recent life tables for small areas to generate
                 up-to-date estimates. Life expectancy rates and changes in
                 life expectancy for counties are compared to the life
                 expectancies across nations in 2000 and 2007. We calculate the
                 number of calendar years behind each county is in 2000 and
                 2007 compared to an international life expectancy time series.
                 RESULTS: Across US counties, life expectancy in 2007 ranged
                 from 65.9 to 81.1 years for men and 73.5 to 86.0 years for
                 women. When compared against a time series of life expectancy
                 in the 10 nations with the lowest mortality, US counties range
                 from being 15 calendar years ahead to over 50 calendar years
                 behind for men and 16 calendar years ahead to over 50 calendar
                 years behind for women. County life expectancy for black men
                 ranges from 59.4 to 77.2 years, with counties ranging from
                 seven to over 50 calendar years behind the international
                 frontier; for black women, the range is 69.6 to 82.6 years,
                 with counties ranging from eight to over 50 calendar years
                 behind. Between 2000 and 2007, 80\% (men) and 91\% (women) of
                 American counties fell in standing against this international
                 life expectancy standard. CONCLUSIONS: The US has extremely
                 large geographic and racial disparities, with some communities
                 having life expectancies already well behind those of the
                 best-performing nations. At the same time, relative
                 performance for most communities continues to drop. Efforts to
                 address these issues will need to tackle the leading
                 preventable causes of death.",

                 patterns of alcohol consumption. DESIGN: Prospective study of
                 mortality in relation to alcohol drinking habits in 1978, with
                 causes of death sought over the next 13 years (to 1991).
                 SUBJECTS: 12,321 British male doctors born between 1900 and
                 1930 (mean 1916) who replied to a postal questionnaire in
                 1978. Those written to in 1978 were the survivors of a long
                 running prospective study of the effects of smoking that had
                 begun in 1951 and was still continuing. RESULTS: Men were
                 divided on the basis of their response to the 1978
                 questionnaire into two groups according to whether or not they
                 had ever had any type of vascular disease, diabetes, or ``life
                 threatening disease'' and into seven groups according to the
                 amount of alcohol they drank. By 1991 almost a third had died.
                 All statistical analyses of mortality were standardised for
                 age, calendar year, and smoking habit. There was a U shaped
                 relation between all cause mortality and the average amount of
                 alcohol reportedly drunk; those who reported drinking 8-14
                 units of alcohol a week (corresponding to an average of one to
                 two units a day) had the lowest risks. The causes of death
                 were grouped into three main categories: ``alcohol augmented''
                 causes (6\% of all deaths: cirrhosis, liver cancer, upper
                 aerodigestive (mouth, oesophagus, larynx, and pharynx) cancer,
                 alcoholism, poisoning, or injury), ischaemic heart disease
                 (33\% of all deaths), and other causes. The few deaths from
                 alcohol augmented causes showed, at least among regular
                 drinkers, a progressive trend, with the risk increasing with
                 dose. In contrast, the many deaths from ischaemic heart
                 disease showed no significant trend among regular drinkers,
                 but there were significantly lower rates in regular drinkers
                 than in non-drinkers. The aggregate of all other causes showed
                 a U shaped dose-response relation similar to that for all
                 cause mortality. Similar differences persisted irrespective of
                 a history of previous disease, age (under 75 or 75 and older),
                 and period of follow up (first five and last eight years).
                 Some, but apparently not much, of the excess mortality in
                 non-drinkers could be attributed to the inclusion among them
                 of a small proportion of former drinkers. CONCLUSION: The
                 consumption of alcohol appeared to reduce the risk of
                 ischaemic heart disease, largely irrespective of amount. Among
                 regular drinkers mortality from all causes combined increased
                 progressively with amount drunk above 21 units a week. Among
                 British men in middle or older age the consumption of an
                 average of one or two units of alcohol a day is associated
                 with significantly lower all cause mortality than is the
                 consumption of no alcohol, or the consumption of substantial
                 amounts. Above about three units (two American units) of
                 alcohol a day, progressively greater levels of consumption are
                 associated with progressively higher all cause mortality.",

                 17-year median follow-up, 2512 deaths occurred (804 [32\%] due
                 to cardiovascular disease). In multivariate analyses, coffee
                 intake was positively associated with all-cause mortality in

                 screen-based entertainment (``screen time'') with all-cause
                 mortality and clinically confirmed cardiovascular disease

                 regardless of physical activity participation, studies with
                 hard outcomes are scarce. METHODS: A population sample of

                 3.96) for participants engaging in $\geq$4 h/day of screen
                 time relative to <2 h/day. Adjusting for physical activity
                 attenuated these associations only slightly (all-cause
                 mortality: HR: 1.48, 95\% CI: 1.04 to 2.13; CVD events: HR:
                 2.25, 95\% CI: 1.30 to 3.89). Exclusion of participants with
                 CVD events in the first 2 years of follow-up and previous
                 cancer registrations did not change these results appreciably.
                 Approximately 25\% of the association between screen time and
                 CVD events was explained collectively by C-reactive protein,
                 body mass index, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Recreational sitting, as reflected by
                 television/screen viewing time, is related to raised mortality
                 and CVD risk regardless of physical activity participation.
                 Inflammatory and metabolic risk factors partly explain this
                 relationship.",
