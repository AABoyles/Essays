  abstract    = "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) often exists in a state of
                 heteroplasmy, in which mutant mtDNA co-exists in cells with
                 wild-type mtDNA. High frequencies of pathogenic mtDNA result
                 in maternally inherited diseases; maternally and somatically
                 acquired mutations also accumulate over time and contribute to
                 diseases of ageing. Reducing heteroplasmy is therefore a
                 therapeutic goal and in vivo models in post-mitotic tissues
                 are needed to facilitate these studies. Here we describe a
                 transgene-based model of a heteroplasmic lethal mtDNA deletion
                 (mtDNA($\Delta$)) in adult Drosophila muscle. Stimulation of
                 autophagy, activation of the PINK1/parkin pathway or decreased
                 levels of mitofusin result in a selective decrease in
                 mtDNA($\Delta$). Decreased levels of mitofusin and increased
                 levels of ATPIF1, an inhibitor of ATP synthase
                 reversal-dependent mitochondrial repolarization, result in a
                 further decrease in mtDNA($\Delta$) levels. These results show
                 that an adult post-mitotic tissue can be cleansed of a
                 deleterious genome, suggesting that therapeutic removal of
                 mutant mtDNA can be achieved.",

                 population is suffering from age-related cognitive
                 impairments, making it important to elucidate a means to
                 combat the effects of aging. Here we report that exposure of
                 an aged animal to young blood can counteract and reverse
                 pre-existing effects of brain aging at the molecular,
                 structural, functional and cognitive level. Genome-wide
                 microarray analysis of heterochronic parabionts--in which
                 circulatory systems of young and aged animals are
                 connected--identified synaptic plasticity-related
                 transcriptional changes in the hippocampus of aged mice.
                 Dendritic spine density of mature neurons increased and
                 synaptic plasticity improved in the hippocampus of aged
                 heterochronic parabionts. At the cognitive level, systemic
                 administration of young blood plasma into aged mice improved
                 age-related cognitive impairments in both contextual fear
                 conditioning and spatial learning and memory. Structural and
                 cognitive enhancements elicited by exposure to young blood are
                 mediated, in part, by activation of the cyclic AMP response
                 element binding protein (Creb) in the aged hippocampus. Our
                 data indicate that exposure of aged mice to young blood late
                 in life is capable of rejuvenating synaptic plasticity and

  abstract    = "Coffee, after water, is the most widely consumed beverage in
                 the United States, and is the principal source of caffeine
                 intake among adults. The biological effects of coffee may be
                 substantial and are not limited to the actions of caffeine.
                 Coffee is a complex beverage containing hundreds of
                 biologically active compounds, and the health effects of
                 chronic coffee intake are wide ranging. From a cardiovascular
                 (CV) standpoint, coffee consumption may reduce the risk of
                 type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, as well as other
                 conditions associated with CV risk such as obesity and
                 depression; but it may adversely affect lipid profiles
                 depending on how the beverage is prepared. Regardless, a
                 growing body of data suggests that habitual coffee consumption
                 is neutral to beneficial regarding the risks of a variety of
                 adverse CV outcomes including coronary heart disease,
                 congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, and stroke. Moreover,
                 large epidemiological studies suggest that regular coffee
                 drinkers have reduced risks of mortality, both CV and
                 all-cause. The potential benefits also include protection
                 against neurodegenerative diseases, improved asthma control,
                 and lower risk of select gastrointestinal diseases. A daily
                 intake of ∼2 to 3 cups of coffee appears to be safe and is
                 associated with neutral to beneficial effects for most of the
                 studied health outcomes. However, most of the data on coffee's
                 health effects are based on observational data, with very few
                 randomized, controlled studies, and association does not prove
                 causation. Additionally, the possible advantages of regular
                 coffee consumption have to be weighed against potential risks
                 (which are mostly related to its high caffeine content)
                 including anxiety, insomnia, tremulousness, and palpitations,

                 and social and medical programs tied to the size and health

                 have based speculations about the upper limits of human
                 longevity on observations of past trends in mortality. Here
                 the estimate of the upper bound is based on hypothesized
                 reductions in current mortality rates necessary to achieve a
                 life expectancy at birth from 80 to 120 years and an
                 expectation of life at age 50 from 30 to 70 years. With the
                 use of conditional probabilities of death from complete life
                 tables for the United States, reductions in mortality required
                 to achieve extreme longevity (that is, 80 to 120 years) were

                 at all ages by 55\%, and at ages 50 and over by 60\%. Given
                 that hypothetical cures for major degenerative diseases would
                 reduce overall mortality by 75\%, it seems highly unlikely

  abstract  = "Driven by technological progress, human life expectancy has
               increased greatly since the nineteenth century. Demographic
               evidence has revealed an ongoing reduction in old-age mortality
               and a rise of the maximum age at death, which may gradually
               extend human longevity. Together with observations that lifespan
               in various animal species is flexible and can be increased by
               genetic or pharmaceutical intervention, these results have led
               to suggestions that longevity may not be subject to strict,
               species-specific genetic constraints. Here, by analysing global
               demographic data, we show that improvements in survival with age
               tend to decline after age 100, and that the age at death of the
               world’s oldest person has not increased since the 1990s. Our
               results strongly suggest that the maximum lifespan of humans is
               fixed and subject to natural constraints.",

                 health and life expectancy, based on individuals' willingness
                 to pay. We then apply the framework to past and prospective
                 reductions in mortality risks, both overall and for specific
                 life-threatening diseases. We calculate (i) the social values
                 of increased longevity for men and women over the 20th
                 century; (ii) the social value of progress against various
                 diseases after 1970; and (iii) the social value of potential
                 future progress against various major categories of disease.
                 The historical gains from increased longevity have been
                 enormous. Over the 20th century, cumulative gains in life
                 expectancy were worth over $1.2 million per person for both
                 men and women. Between 1970 and 2000 increased longevity added
                 about $3.2 trillion per year to national wealth, an uncounted
                 value equal to about half of average annual GDP over the
                 period. Reduced mortality from heart disease alone has
                 increased the value of life by about $1.5 trillion per year

                 health care are also extremely large. Even a modest 1 percent

  abstract    = "Importance: The relationship between income and life
                 expectancy is well established but remains poorly understood.
                 Objectives: To measure the level, time trend, and geographic
                 variability in the association between income and life
                 expectancy and to identify factors related to small area
                 variation. Design and Setting: Income data for the US
                 population were obtained from 1.4 billion deidentified tax
                 records between 1999 and 2014. Mortality data were obtained
                 from Social Security Administration death records. These data
                 were used to estimate race- and ethnicity-adjusted life
                 expectancy at 40 years of age by household income percentile,
                 sex, and geographic area, and to evaluate factors associated
                 with differences in life expectancy. Exposure: Pretax
                 household earnings as a measure of income. Main Outcomes and
                 Measures: Relationship between income and life expectancy;
                 trends in life expectancy by income group; geographic
                 variation in life expectancy levels and trends by income
                 group; and factors associated with differences in life
                 expectancy across areas. Results: The sample consisted of 1
                 408 287 218 person-year observations for individuals aged 40
                 to 76 years (mean age, 53.0 years; median household earnings
                 among working individuals, \$61 175 per year). There were 4
                 114 380 deaths among men (mortality rate, 596.3 per 100 000)
                 and 2 694 808 deaths among women (mortality rate, 375.1 per
                 100 000). The analysis yielded 4 results. First, higher income
                 was associated with greater longevity throughout the income
                 distribution. The gap in life expectancy between the richest
                 1\% and poorest 1\% of individuals was 14.6 years (95\% CI,
                 14.4 to 14.8 years) for men and 10.1 years (95\% CI, 9.9 to
                 10.3 years) for women. Second, inequality in life expectancy
                 increased over time. Between 2001 and 2014, life expectancy
                 increased by 2.34 years for men and 2.91 years for women in
                 the top 5\% of the income distribution, but by only 0.32 years
                 for men and 0.04 years for women in the bottom 5\% (P < .001
                 for the differences for both sexes). Third, life expectancy
                 for low-income individuals varied substantially across local
                 areas. In the bottom income quartile, life expectancy differed
                 by approximately 4.5 years between areas with the highest and
                 lowest longevity. Changes in life expectancy between 2001 and
                 2014 ranged from gains of more than 4 years to losses of more
                 than 2 years across areas. Fourth, geographic differences in
                 life expectancy for individuals in the lowest income quartile
                 were significantly correlated with health behaviors such as
                 smoking (r = -0.69, P < .001), but were not significantly
                 correlated with access to medical care, physical environmental
                 factors, income inequality, or labor market conditions. Life
                 expectancy for low-income individuals was positively
                 correlated with the local area fraction of immigrants (r =
                 0.72, P < .001), fraction of college graduates (r = 0.42, P <
                 .001), and government expenditures (r = 0.57, P < .001).
                 Conclusions and Relevance: In the United States between 2001
                 and 2014, higher income was associated with greater longevity,
                 and differences in life expectancy across income groups
                 increased over time. However, the association between life
                 expectancy and income varied substantially across areas;
                 differences in longevity across income groups decreased in
                 some areas and increased in others. The differences in life
                 expectancy were correlated with health behaviors and local
                 area characteristics.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: The quality and quantity of individuals' social
                 relationships has been linked not only to mental health but
                 also to both morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVES: This
                 meta-analytic review was conducted to determine the extent to
                 which social relationships influence risk for mortality, which
                 aspects of social relationships are most highly predictive,
                 and which factors may moderate the risk. DATA EXTRACTION: Data
                 were extracted on several participant characteristics,
                 including cause of mortality, initial health status, and
                 pre-existing health conditions, as well as on study
                 characteristics, including length of follow-up and type of
                 assessment of social relationships. RESULTS: Across 148
                 studies (308,849 participants), the random effects weighted
                 average effect size was OR = 1.50 (95\% CI 1.42 to 1.59),
                 indicating a 50\% increased likelihood of survival for
                 participants with stronger social relationships. This finding
                 remained consistent across age, sex, initial health status,
                 cause of death, and follow-up period. Significant differences
                 were found across the type of social measurement evaluated
                 (p<0.001); the association was strongest for complex measures
                 of social integration (OR = 1.91; 95\% CI 1.63 to 2.23) and
                 lowest for binary indicators of residential status (living
                 alone versus with others) (OR = 1.19; 95\% CI 0.99 to 1.44).
                 CONCLUSIONS: The influence of social relationships on risk for
                 mortality is comparable with well-established risk factors for
                 mortality. Please see later in the article for the Editors'

  abstract = "Population turnover is necessary for progressive evolution. In
              the context of a niche with fixed carrying capacity, aging
              contributes to the rate of population turnover. Theoretically, a
              population in which death is programmed on a fixed schedule can
              evolve more rapidly than one in which population turnover is left
              to a random death rate. Could aging evolve on this basis?
              Quantitative realization of this idea is problematic, since the
              short-term individual fitness cost is likely to eliminate any
              hypothetical gene for programmed death before the long-term
              benefit can be realized. In 2011, one of us proposed the first
              quantitative model based on this mechanism that robustly evolves
              a finite, programmed life span. That model was based on a viscous
              population in a rapidly changing environment. Here, we strip this
              model to its essence and eliminate the assumption of
              environmental change. We conclude that there is no obvious way in
              which this model is unrealistic, and that it may indeed capture
              an important principle of nature’s workings. We suggest aging may
              be understood within the context of the emerging science of

  abstract    = "AIMS: Clinical and observational studies have shown an
                 increased risk of cardiovascular events and death associated
                 with sulphonylureas versus metformin. However, it has never
                 been determined whether this was due to the beneficial effects
                 of metformin or detrimental effects of sulphonylureas. The
                 objective of this study was therefore to compare all-cause
                 mortality in diabetic patients treated first-line with either
                 sulphonylurea or metformin monotherapy with that in matched
                 individuals without diabetes. METHODS: We used retrospective
                 observational data from the UK Clinical Practice Research
                 Datalink (CPRD) from 2000. Subjects with type 2 diabetes who
                 progressed to first-line treatment with metformin or
                 sulphonylurea monotherapy were selected and matched to people
                 without diabetes. Progression to all-cause mortality was
                 compared using parametric survival models that included a
                 range of relevant co-variables. RESULTS: We identified 78,241
                 subjects treated with metformin, 12,222 treated with
                 sulphonylurea, and 90,463 matched subjects without diabetes.
                 This resulted in a total, censored follow-up period of 503,384
                 years. There were 7498 deaths in total, representing
                 unadjusted mortality rates of 14.4 and 15.2, and 50.9 and 28.7
                 deaths per 1000 person-years for metformin monotherapy and
                 their matched controls, and sulphonylurea monotherapy and
                 their matched controls, respectively. With reference to
                 observed survival in diabetic patients initiated with
                 metformin monotherapy [survival time ratio (STR) = 1.0],
                 adjusted median survival time was 15\% lower (STR = 0.85, 95\%
                 CI 0.81-0.90) in matched individuals without diabetes and 38\%
                 lower (0.62, 0.58-0.66) in diabetic patients treated with
                 sulphonylurea monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with type 2
                 diabetes initiated with metformin monotherapy had longer
                 survival than did matched, non-diabetic controls. Those
                 treated with sulphonylurea had markedly reduced survival
                 compared with both matched controls and those receiving
                 metformin monotherapy. This supports the position of metformin
                 as first-line therapy and implies that metformin may confer
                 benefit in non-diabetes. Sulphonylurea remains a concern.",

                 diabetes, has been noted to extend healthspan of nondiabetic
                 mice, but this outcome, and the molecular mechanisms that
                 underlie it, have received relatively little experimental
                 attention. To develop a genetic model for study of biguanide
                 effects on healthspan, we investigated metformin impact on
                 aging Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that metformin
                 increases nematode healthspan, slowing lipofuscin
                 accumulation, extending median lifespan, and prolonging
                 youthful locomotory ability in a dose-dependent manner.
                 Genetic data suggest that metformin acts through a mechanism
                 similar to that operative in eating-impaired dietary
                 restriction (DR) mutants, but independent of the insulin
                 signaling pathway. Energy sensor AMPK and AMPK-activating
                 kinase LKB1, which are activated in mammals by metformin
                 treatment, are essential for health benefits in C. elegans,
                 suggesting that metformin engages a metabolic loop conserved
                 across phyla. We also show that the conserved oxidative
                 stress-responsive transcription factor SKN-1/Nrf2 is essential
                 for metformin healthspan benefits in C. elegans, a mechanistic
                 requirement not previously described in mammals. skn-1, which
                 functions in nematode sensory neurons to promote DR longevity
                 benefits and in intestines for oxidative stress resistance
                 lifespan benefits, must be expressed in both neurons and
                 intestines for metformin-promoted healthspan extension,
                 supporting that metformin improves healthy middle-life aging
                 by activating both DR and antioxidant defense longevity
                 pathways. In addition to defining molecular players operative
                 in metformin healthspan benefits, our data suggest that
                 metformin may be a plausible pharmacological intervention to

                 and cardiovascular mortality are inconsistent; the magnitude
                 of associations between resting heart rate and risk of
                 all-cause and cardiovascular mortality varies across studies.
                 We performed a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies to
                 quantitatively evaluate the associations in the general
                 population. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase and MEDLINE
                 from inception to Jan. 1, 2015. We used a random-effects model
                 to combine study-specific relative risks and 95\% confidence
                 intervals (CIs). We used restricted cubic spline functions to
                 assess the dose-response relation. RESULTS: A total of 46
                 studies were included in the meta-analysis, involving 1 246
                 203 patients and 78 349 deaths for all-cause mortality, and
                 848 320 patients and 25 800 deaths for cardiovascular
                 mortality. The relative risk with 10 beats/min increment of
                 resting heart rate was 1.09 (95\% CI 1.07-1.12) for all-cause
                 mortality and 1.08 (95\% CI 1.06-1.10) for cardiovascular
                 mortality. Compared with the lowest category, patients with a
                 resting heart rate of 60-80 beats/min had a relative risk of
                 1.12 (95\% CI 1.07-1.17) for all-cause mortality and 1.08
                 (95\% CI 0.99-1.17) for cardiovascular mortality, and those
                 with a resting heart rate of greater than 80 beats/min had a
                 relative risk of 1.45 (95\% CI 1.34-1.57) for all-cause
                 mortality and 1.33 (95\% CI 1.19-1.47) for cardiovascular
                 mortality. Overall, the results did not differ after
                 adjustment for traditional risk factors for cardiovascular
                 disease. Compared with 45 beats/min, the risk of all-cause
                 mortality increased significantly with increasing resting
                 heart rate in a linear relation, but a significantly increased
                 risk of cardiovascular mortality was observed at 90 beats/min.
                 Substantial heterogeneity and publication bias were detected.
                 INTERPRETATION: Higher resting heart rate was independently
                 associated with increased risks of all-cause and
                 cardiovascular mortality. This indicates that resting heart
                 rate is a predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality

              with risk of subsequent total and cause-specific mortality among
              74,890 women in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), 93,054 women in
              the NHS 2, and 40,557 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up

              person-years of follow-up, 19,524 women and 12,432 men died.
              Consumption of total, caffeinated, and decaffeinated coffee were

                 Librarian-designed search strategies were used to search the

                 The database search was performed again in March 2005. We also
                 reviewed reference lists from included studies and content
                 expert files. Eligible studies were randomized trials that
                 compared any formulation of commercially available
                 testosterone with placebo and that assessed cardiovascular
                 risk factors (lipid fractions, blood pressure, blood glucose),
                 cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, nonfatal
                 myocardial infarction, angina or claudication,
                 revascularization, stroke), and cardiovascular surrogate end

                 collected data on participants, testosterone administration,
                 and outcome measures. We assessed study quality with attention
                 to allocation concealment, blinding, and loss to follow-up.
                 RESULTS: The 30 trials included 1642 men, 808 of whom were
                 treated with testosterone. Overall, the trials had limited
                 reporting of methodological features that prevent biased

                 enrolled few patients, and were of brief duration (only 4
                 trials followed up patients for > 1 year). The median loss to
                 follow-up across all 30 trials was 9\%. Testosterone use in
                 men with low testosterone levels led to inconsequential
                 changes in blood pressure and glycemia and in all lipid

                 outcomes. For reasons we could not explain statistically, the

                 testosterone use in men is not associated with important
                 cardiovascular effects. Patients and clinicians need large
                 randomized trials of men at risk for cardiovascular disease to
                 better inform the safety of long-term testosterone use.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: We performed a meta-analysis of randomized
                 clinical trials to determine the risks of adverse events
                 associated with testosterone replacement in older men.
                 METHODS: The MEDLINE database was searched from 1966 to April
                 2004, using testosterone as the indexing term; limits included
                 human, male, > or =45 years old, and randomized controlled
                 trial. Of the 417 studies thus identified, 19 met the
                 inclusion criteria: testosterone replacement for at least 90
                 days, men > or =45 years old with low or low-normal
                 testosterone level, randomized controlled trial, and medically
                 stable men. Odds ratios (ORs) were pooled using a random
                 effects model, assuming heterogeneous results across studies,
                 and were weighted for sample size. RESULTS: In the 19 studies
                 that met eligibility criteria, 651 men were treated with
                 testosterone and 433 with placebo. The combined rate of all
                 prostate events was significantly greater in
                 testosterone-treated men than in placebo-treated men (OR =
                 1.78, 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-2.95). Rates of
                 prostate cancer, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >4 ng/ml, and
                 prostate biopsies were numerically higher in the testosterone
                 group than in the placebo group, although differences between
                 the groups were not individually statistically significant.
                 Testosterone-treated men were nearly four times as likely to
                 have hematocrit >50\% as placebo-treated men (OR = 3.69, 95\%
                 CI, 1.82-7.51). The frequency of cardiovascular events, sleep
                 apnea or death was not significantly different between the two
                 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Testosterone replacement in older men was
                 associated with a significantly higher risk of detection of
                 prostate events and of hematocrit >50\% than was placebo;
                 hematocrit increase was the most frequent adverse event
                 associated with testosterone replacement. These data reaffirm
                 the need to monitor hematocrit, PSA, and digital examination
                 of the prostate during testosterone replacement in older men.",

                 DNA repair on lifespan and resistance to stress factors in
                 Drosophila melanogaster. Stress factors included hyperthermia,
                 oxidative stress, and starvation. Overexpression was either
                 constitutive or conditional and either ubiquitous or
                 tissue-specific (nervous system). Overexpressed genes included
                 those involved in recognition of DNA damage (homologs of HUS1,
                 CHK2), nucleotide and base excision repair (homologs of XPF,

                 breaks (homologs of BRCA2, XRCC3, KU80 and WRNexo). The
                 overexpression of different DNA repair genes led to both
                 positive and negative effects on lifespan and stress

                 negatively impacted lifespan and stress resistance, the

  abstract    = "Several animal species are considered to exhibit what is
                 called negligible senescence, i.e. they do not show signs of
                 functional decline or any increase of mortality with age.
                 Recent studies in naked mole rat and long-lived sea urchins
                 showed that these species do not alter their gene-expression
                 profiles with age as much as other organisms do. This is
                 consistent with exceptional endurance of naked mole rat
                 tissues to various genotoxic stresses. We conjectured,
                 therefore, that the lifelong transcriptional stability of an
                 organism may be a key determinant of longevity. We analyzed
                 the stability of a simple genetic-network model and found that
                 under most common circumstances, such a gene network is
                 inherently unstable. Over a time it undergoes an exponential
                 accumulation of gene-regulation deviations leading to death.
                 However, should the repair systems be sufficiently effective,
                 the gene network can stabilize so that gene damage remains
                 constrained along with mortality of the organism. We
                 investigate the relationship between stress-resistance and
                 aging and suggest that the unstable regime may provide a
                 mathematical basis for the Gompertz ``law'' of aging in many
                 species. At the same time, this model accounts for the
                 apparently age-independent mortality observed in some
                 exceptionally long-lived animals.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: The United States health care debate has focused
                 on the nation's uniquely high rates of lack of insurance and
                 poor health outcomes relative to other high-income countries.
                 Large disparities in health outcomes are well-documented in
                 the US, but the most recent assessment of county disparities
                 in mortality is from 1999. It is critical to tracking progress
                 of health reform legislation to have an up-to-date assessment
                 of disparities in life expectancy across counties. US
                 disparities can be seen more clearly in the context of how
                 progress in each county compares to international trends.
                 METHODS: We use newly released mortality data by age, sex, and
                 county for the US from 2000 to 2007 to compute life tables
                 separately for each sex, for all races combined, for whites,
                 and for blacks. We propose, validate, and apply novel methods
                 to estimate recent life tables for small areas to generate
                 up-to-date estimates. Life expectancy rates and changes in
                 life expectancy for counties are compared to the life
                 expectancies across nations in 2000 and 2007. We calculate the
                 number of calendar years behind each county is in 2000 and
                 2007 compared to an international life expectancy time series.
                 RESULTS: Across US counties, life expectancy in 2007 ranged
                 from 65.9 to 81.1 years for men and 73.5 to 86.0 years for
                 women. When compared against a time series of life expectancy
                 in the 10 nations with the lowest mortality, US counties range
                 from being 15 calendar years ahead to over 50 calendar years
                 behind for men and 16 calendar years ahead to over 50 calendar
                 years behind for women. County life expectancy for black men
                 ranges from 59.4 to 77.2 years, with counties ranging from
                 seven to over 50 calendar years behind the international
                 frontier; for black women, the range is 69.6 to 82.6 years,
                 with counties ranging from eight to over 50 calendar years
                 behind. Between 2000 and 2007, 80\% (men) and 91\% (women) of
                 American counties fell in standing against this international
                 life expectancy standard. CONCLUSIONS: The US has extremely
                 large geographic and racial disparities, with some communities
                 having life expectancies already well behind those of the
                 best-performing nations. At the same time, relative
                 performance for most communities continues to drop. Efforts to
                 address these issues will need to tackle the leading
                 preventable causes of death.",
