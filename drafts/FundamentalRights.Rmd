title: "Fundamental Rights"

I believe that fundamental human rights extend far beyond the conventional American conception. The Declaration of Independence famously enumerated the “inalienable rights” as “Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.”

## Life

Human Life is fragile. If you can be certain of one thing in your entire life, be certain that the only inviolable laws in the universe are the laws of physics, and those laws want you to die.

* Breathable Air
* Potable Water
* Edible Food
* Safety
* Watertight Shelter
* Health Care

## Liberty

## Pursuit of Happiness

* High Speed Internet Access (Yes, really)

I believe that humans are entitled to these things because, at this exact moment in history, we have the means to ensure that all humans can have these things.
