title: "Some Considerations About SETI"
---

The news ran abuzz last month with the announcement of a new, $100 Million [initiative](http://www.breakthroughinitiatives.org/) to sniff out signs of life in the Universe outside of Earth. The promotional video, produced by Seth MacFarlane, is vivid and exciting, hearkening to the excitement of discovery in a world far, far larger than the explorers of the age of discovery could have imagined.

And yet, I'm not excited. The Universe is vast and, so far as we can tell, devoid of intelligent life.  This is a strong assumption from which to extrapolate, and yet we have strong evidence to back it up. Every day that [SETI](http://www.seti.org/) has failed to turn up a signal from an alien intelligence is another data point against the hypothesis that intelligent life has evolved outside of our biosphere. This is the [Fermi Paradox](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html). An important, related concept is that of the _Great Silence_. Not only have we not been visited by an intelligent aliens (or robotic probes sent thereby), we haven't even _heard_ from any intelligent aliens. All the noise in the universe seems to be natural--except the noises we make.

## But what if we're not alone?

If we are not alone, then perhaps the intelligent aliens are less technologically sophisticated than we are and don't enjoy significantly faster technological progress. Or they are mildly more advanced than we are, but develop at a much slower pace. Either of these scenarios represent minimal-to-absent threat to humanity, but these are highly unlikely. Consider that intelligent humans have been around for more-or-less 200,000 years but in all that time we only started sending out messages that could reach alien civilizations about 80 years ago. Oh, and [we don't do that so much anymore](http://what-if.xkcd.com/47/): if unfriendly aliens hear us, they might get interested and come take over. This is an outcome we very much want to avoid (as Dr. [Hawking himself will testify](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/36769422/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/hawking-aliens-may-pose-risks-earth/#.Vaz0TCpViko)). [caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="740"][![](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/interstellar_memes.png)](http://xkcd.com/1212/) Not directly related, but I needed to include this.[/caption] If we are not alone, it is highly likely that the intelligent aliens are _more_ technologically sophisticated than we are. The reason for this is the [annoying youth of our star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun). Writ short, our current cosmological models predict that stars like our sun started forming about 3 billion years before the sun did. This means that aliens on an earth-like planet might have had a 3 billion year head start on us. Just imagine the technological progress we've made in your lifetime (remember "car phones"?), and then imagine what 3 billion years of such progress looks like.

## OK, so what if we ARE alone?

If we are, in fact, alone, then searching for intelligent life is a waste of money. Sadly, we'll never be certain of this fact, if it is true.

## So what SHOULD we be doing?

$100 Million Bones goes a long way. It could buy and distribute 10 million long-lasting insecticide nets, saving almost 30,000 lives from death by malaria. It could [fundamentally transform](https://intelligence.org/2015/07/17/miris-2015-summer-fundraiser/) the landscape of Artificial Intelligence safety research, possibly accelerating the construction of a safe superintelligence (which would then assume both the comparative and absolute advantages in setting and executing moral agendas).
