Definition of Morality

Morality as an Economic Phenomenon

## Rationality

It’s become a favored pass-time of our culture to take pot-shots at "rationality." The implicit logic behind these attacks usually goes something like this: "People frequently do silly things (that I would never do). Therefore, people are irrational, and economists are fools." Economists, I think, don’t lose a ton of sleep over these criticisms. After all, the logic above fails to engage with any well-defined  conception of rationality. To an Economist, "rationality" means that for any decision someone has to make:

* the decision maker can compare all available options (i.e. preferences are complete)
* the decision maker doesn’t have any circular preference orderings (i.e. preferences are intransitive)

So, based on this narrow, technical definition of rationality, are humans rational?

Uuuuuum, No.

## Humans are not Rational

There are a ton of ways that our reasoning fails to generate decisions which are consistent with the two constraints of rationality.

## Humans are not Morally Consistent

This brings us to the unequivocal monarch of all moral thought experiments, [The Trolley Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem).

> [Y]ou are standing by a railroad track when you notice that a trolley, with no one aboard, is rolling down the track, heading for a group of five people. They will all be killed if the trolley continues on its present track. The only thing you can do to prevent these five deaths is to throw a switch that will divert the trolley onto a side track, where it will kill only one person.

Notice the simple mathematics of the situation: you can do nothing and five people will die, or you can do something and only one person will die. [One study based on a web survey](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01167.x/full) showed that roughly 89% of respondents would pull the switch (i.e. killing the one to save the five). 

[Ed. Note: Yeah, yeah, I know. [Surveys are crap](http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/12/noisy-poll-results-and-reptilian-muslim-climatologists-from-mars/). Web Surveys are doubly crap. Social Science is crap. Caveat Emptor. That said, the point I’m getting to is intuitive and robust, so shut up.]

So far, so good, but:

> As before, a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. You are on a bridge under which it will pass, and you can stop it by putting something very heavy in front of it. As it happens, there is a very fat man next to you — your only way to stop the trolley is to push him over the bridge and onto the track, killing him to save five. Should you proceed?

Notice that the simple mathematics of the situation have not changed. The morally significant elements of the experiment (the people) are in an exactly isomorphic situation. Despite this fact, the same aforementioned web survey now found that only 11% of respondents would push the fat man.

[Ed. Note: I’m really, really not interested in discussing why the trolley problem isn’t "realistic." See [Julia Galef’s excellent video introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cbnep17Mwqg) to [the Least Convenient Possible World Principle](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2k/the_least_convenient_possible_world/) for an explanation of why.]

(By the way, there’s [a delightful community of people on Facebook generating dank new variations of the Trolley Problem](https://www.facebook.com/TrolleyProblemMemes/).)
