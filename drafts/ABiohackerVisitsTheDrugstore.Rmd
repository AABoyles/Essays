title: "A Biohacker Visits the Drugstore"

## Why?

So far as I can tell, most biohackers purchase exactly what they want off of the internet. Purchasing drugs off the internet is sketchy af. Even the most reputable sites exude many of the uninspiring flags 

By contrast, shopping at your local CVS or Walgreens seems comparatively safe. Surely they wouldn't put these things on a self, available to anyone without a perscription if it wasn't *completely safe*, right?

## Safety

Well, it isn't necessarily completely safe. Nothing is.
