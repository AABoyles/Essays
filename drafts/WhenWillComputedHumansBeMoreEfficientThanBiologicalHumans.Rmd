title: "When Will Computed Humans be More Efficient than Biological Humans?"
---

The AI Impacts project has worked on predicting AGI by extrapolating forward from Moore's Law. To that end, they've published some excellent articles on the brain capacities and the computed equivalents: [Brain Performance in FLOPS](http://aiimpacts.org/brain-performance-in-flops/), [Brain Performance in TEPS](http://aiimpacts.org/brain-performance-in-teps/), and [Brain Information Capacity](http://aiimpacts.org/information-storage-in-the-brain/). One topic they haven't yet broached is the brain's power consumption. Let us assume that Whole Brain Emulations become computationally possible in the relatively near future (on the order of decades). How long will it be before computed human minds are more energy-efficient than biological brains? 

The human brain consumes [on the order of 10 watts](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2006/03/23/youre-a-dim-bulb-and-i-mean-that-in-the-best-possible-way/). This is somewhat surprising when compared to, for example, an ordinary desktop computer, which will use about 350 watts. However, as processors have gotten predictable faster, they have also gotten predictably more energy-efficient. This is modeled by a relationship called [Koomey's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koomey%27s_law). Roughly stated, "at a fixed computing load, the amount of battery you need will fall by a factor of two every year and a half." [10.1109/MAHC.2010.28]

The model is fitted using the regression equation $y=\exp(0.4401939x-849.161)$ where _y_ is the cost of Computations in kWh and _x_ is the year (on the Gregorian calendar). As previously noted, the human brain expends 10W, or .01kWh per hour. Given the smallest estimate, the human brain performs approximately [latex]10^{13.5}[/latex] floating-point operations per second (FLOPS). [latex]10^{13.5}[/latex] FLOPS is equivalent to about [latex]10^{17}[/latex] floating-point operations per hour (FLOPH). All together, we can estimate that the computational efficiency of the brain is approximately [latex]10^{19}[/latex] computations per kWh. According to Koomey's regression model, that should mean that computers will catch up to the brain's computational efficiency around mid-2028. On the other hand, the largest estimate suggests that the brain performs around [latex]10^{25}[/latex]FLOPS. This would require the trend to persist until nearly 2089\. Either way, barring an existential catastrophe, it looks as though the brain is on track to be unseated as the known universe's most efficient computer sometime this century.
