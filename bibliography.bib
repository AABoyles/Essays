                   is important for determining surface pressure and potential
                   habitability. Molecular nitrogen (N$_2$) constitutes the
                   largest fraction of Earth$'$s atmosphere and is likely to be
                   a major constituent of many terrestrial exoplanet
                   atmospheres. Due to its lack of significant absorption
                   features, N$_2$ is extremely difficult to remotely detect.
                   However, N$_2$ produces an N$_2$-N$_2$ collisional pair,
                   (N$_2$)$_2$, which is spectrally active. Here we report the
                   detection of (N$_2$)$_2$ in Earth$'$s disk-integrated
                   spectrum. By comparing spectra from NASA$'$s EPOXI mission
                   to synthetic spectra from the NASA Astrobiology
                   Institute$'$s Virtual Planetary Laboratory three-dimensional
                   spectral Earth model, we find that (N$_2$)$_2$ absorption
                   produces a ~35$\textbackslash{}\%$ decrease in flux at 4.15
                   $\textbackslash{}mu$m. Quantifying N$_2$ could provide a
                   means of determining bulk atmospheric composition for
                   terrestrial exoplanets and could rule out abiotic O$_2$
                   generation, which is possible in rarefied atmospheres. To
                   explore the potential effects of (N$_2$)$_2$ in exoplanet
                   spectra, we used radiative transfer models to generate
                   synthetic emission and transit transmission spectra of
                   self-consistent N$_2$-CO$_2$-H$_2$O atmospheres, and
                   analytic N$_2$-H$_2$ and N$_2$-H$_2$-CO$_2$ atmospheres. We
                   show that (N$_2$)$_2$ absorption in the wings of the 4.3
                   $\textbackslash{}mu$m CO$_2$ band is strongly dependent on
                   N$_2$ partial pressures above 0.5 bar and can significantly
                   widen this band in thick N$_2$ atmospheres. The (N$_2$)$_2$
                   transit transmission signal is up to 10 ppm for an
                   Earth-size planet with an N$_2$-dominated atmosphere
                   orbiting within the HZ of an M5V star and could be
                   substantially larger for planets with significant H$_2$

  abstract    = "Previous work on possible surface reflectance biosignatures
                 for Earth-like planets has typically focused on analogues to
                 spectral features produced by photosynthetic organisms on
                 Earth, such as the vegetation red edge. Although oxygenic
                 photosynthesis, facilitated by pigments evolved to capture
                 photons, is the dominant metabolism on our planet,
                 pigmentation has evolved for multiple purposes to adapt
                 organisms to their environment. We present an
                 interdisciplinary study of the diversity and detectability of
                 nonphotosynthetic pigments as biosignatures, which includes a
                 description of environments that host nonphotosynthetic
                 biologically pigmented surfaces, and a lab-based experimental
                 analysis of the spectral and broadband color diversity of
                 pigmented organisms on Earth. We test the utility of broadband
                 color to distinguish between Earth-like planets with
                 significant coverage of nonphotosynthetic pigments and those
                 with photosynthetic or nonbiological surfaces, using both 1-D
                 and 3-D spectral models. We demonstrate that, given sufficient
                 surface coverage, nonphotosynthetic pigments could
                 significantly impact the disk-averaged spectrum of a planet.
                 However, we find that due to the possible diversity of
                 organisms and environments, and the confounding effects of the
                 atmosphere and clouds, determination of substantial coverage
                 by biologically produced pigments would be difficult with
                 broadband colors alone and would likely require spectrally
                 resolved data. Key Words:

               early warning of impending crises so they can devise effective
               mitigation plans, mobilize resources, and coordinate responses
               with their foreign counterparts. Over the last 40 years, the US
               government has invested generously in several attempts to build
               crisis forecasting systems that were analytically defensible and

  author    = "Levy, Jack S",
  abstract  = "The apparently accelerating arms race between the United States
               and the Soviet Union and the precarious political conditions
               existing in many parts of the world have given rise to new
               anxiety about the possibility of military confrontation between
               the superpowers. Despite the fateful nature of the risk, we have
               little knowledge, as Jack S. Levy has pointed out, ``of the
               conditions, processes, and events which might combine to
               generate such a calamity. ``No empirically confirmed theory of
               the causes of war exists, and the hypotheses---often
               contradictory---that have been proposed remain untested. As a
               step toward the formulation of a theory of the causes of war
               that can be tested against historical experience, Levy has
               developed a unique data base that will serve as an invaluable
               resource for students of international conflict in coming years.
               War in the Modern Great Power System provides a much-needed
               perspective on the major wars of the past. In this thorough and
               systematic study, Levy carefully defines the Great Power concept
               and identifies the Great Powers and their international wars
               since the late fifteenth century. The resulting compilation of
               war data is unique because of its five-century span and its
               focus on a well-defined set of Great Powers. Turning to a
               quantitative analysis of the characteristics, patterns, and
               trends in war, Levy demonstrates that although wars between the
               Great Powers have become increasingly serious in every respect
               but duration over the last five hundred years, their frequency
               has diminished. He rejects the popular view that the twentieth
               century has been the most warlike on record, and he demonstrates
               that it instead constitutes a return to the historical norm
               after the exceptionally peaceful nineteenth century. Applying
               his data to the question whether war is ``contagious,'' he finds
               that the likelihood of war is indeed highest when another war is
               under way, but that this contagious effect disappears after the
               first war is over. Contrary to the popular ``war-weariness''
               theory, he finds no evidence that war generates an aversion to
               subsequent war. This study, extending the scientific analysis of
               war back over five centuries of international history,
               constitutes a major contribution to our knowledge of
               international conflict. Jack S. Levy, assistant professor of
               government at the University of Texas at Austin, has contributed
               studies of international war to International Studies Quarterly,

                 accompanied the meteoric rise of Facebook as social scientists
                 assess the impact of Facebook on social life. In addition,
                 researchers have recognized the utility of Facebook as a novel
                 tool to observe behavior in a naturalistic setting, test
                 hypotheses, and recruit participants. However, research on
                 Facebook emanates from a wide variety of disciplines, with
                 results being published in a broad range of journals and
                 conference proceedings, making it difficult to keep track of

                 cycles, including facilitating CO2 sequestration and providing
                 climate feedbacks. Thus a key question in Earth's evolution is
                 when did life arise and impact
                 hydrosphere-atmosphere-lithosphere chemical cycles? Until now,
                 evidence for the oldest life on Earth focused on debated
                 stable isotopic signatures of 3,800-3,700 million year
                 (Myr)-old metamorphosed sedimentary rocks and minerals from
                 the Isua supracrustal belt (ISB), southwest Greenland. Here we
                 report evidence for ancient life from a newly exposed outcrop
                 of 3,700-Myr-old metacarbonate rocks in the ISB that contain
                 1-4-cm-high stromatolites-macroscopically layered structures
                 produced by microbial communities. The ISB stromatolites grew
                 in a shallow marine environment, as indicated by seawater-like
                 rare-earth element plus yttrium trace element signatures of
                 the metacarbonates, and by interlayered detrital sedimentary
                 rocks with cross-lamination and storm-wave generated breccias.
                 The ISB stromatolites predate by 220 Myr the previous most
                 convincing and generally accepted multidisciplinary evidence
                 for oldest life remains in the 3,480-Myr-old Dresser Formation
                 of the Pilbara Craton, Australia. The presence of the ISB
                 stromatolites demonstrates the establishment of shallow marine
                 carbonate production with biotic CO2 sequestration by 3,700
                 million years ago (Ma), near the start of Earth's sedimentary
                 record. A sophistication of life by 3,700 Ma is in accord with
                 genetic molecular clock studies placing life's origin in the
                 Hadean eon (>4,000 Ma).",

                 the evolution of life from the late stages of the RNA world
                 through to the emergence of eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The
                 starting point is our model, derived from current RNA
                 activity, of the RNA world just prior to the advent of
                 genetically-encoded protein synthesis. By focusing on the
                 function of the protoribosome we develop a plausible model for
                 the evolution of a protein-synthesizing ribosome from a
                 high-fidelity RNA polymerase that incorporated triplets of
                 oligonucleotides. With the standard assumption that during the
                 evolution of enzymatic activity, catalysis is transferred from
                 RNA --> RNP --> protein, the first proteins in the
                 ``breakthrough organism'' (the first to have encoded protein
                 synthesis) would be nonspecific chaperone-like proteins rather
                 than catalytic. Moreover, because some RNA molecules that
                 pre-date protein synthesis under this model now occur as
                 introns in some of the very earliest proteins, the model
                 predicts these particular introns are older than the exons
                 surrounding them, the ``introns-first'' theory. Many features
                 of the model for the genome organization in the final RNA
                 world ribo-organism are more prevalent in the eukaryotic
                 genome and we suggest that the prokaryotic genome organization
                 (a single, circular genome with one center of replication) was
                 derived from a ``eukaryotic-like'' genome organization (a
                 fragmented linear genome with multiple centers of
                 replication). The steps from the proposed ribo-organism RNA
                 genome --> eukaryotic-like DNA genome --> prokaryotic-like DNA
                 genome are all relatively straightforward, whereas the
                 transition prokaryotic-like genome --> eukaryotic-like genome
                 appears impossible under a Darwinian mechanism of evolution,
                 given the assumption of the transition RNA --> RNP -->
                 protein. A likely molecular mechanism, ``plasmid transfer,''
                 is available for the origin of prokaryotic-type genomes from
                 an eukaryotic-like architecture. Under this model prokaryotes
                 are considered specialized and derived with reduced dependence
                 on ssRNA biochemistry. A functional explanation is that
                 prokaryote ancestors underwent selection for thermophily (high
                 temperature) and/or for rapid reproduction (r selection) at
                 least once in their history.",

  abstract = "Abstract There are widespread concerns that current trends in
              resource-use are unsustainable, but possibilities of
              overshoot/collapse remain controversial. Collapses have occurred
              frequently in history, often followed by centuries of economic,
              intellectual, and population decline. Many different natural and
              social phenomena have been invoked to explain specific collapses,
              but a general explanation remains elusive. In this paper, we
              build a human population dynamics model by adding accumulated
              wealth and economic inequality to a predator--prey model of
              humans and nature. The model structure, and simulated scenarios
              that offer significant implications, are explained. Four
              equations describe the evolution of Elites, Commoners, Nature,
              and Wealth. The model shows Economic Stratification or Ecological
              Strain can independently lead to collapse, in agreement with the
              historical record. The measure ``Carrying Capacity'' is developed
              and its estimation is shown to be a practical means for early
              detection of a collapse. Mechanisms leading to two types of
              collapses are discussed. The new dynamics of this model can also
              reproduce the irreversible collapses found in history. Collapse
              can be avoided, and population can reach a steady state at
              maximum carrying capacity if the rate of depletion of nature is

                   rapidly to the true sequence generating posterior mu, if the

                   finitely computable, estimable, enumerable, and

                   semimeasures. We define seven classes of (semi)measures

              measures of rational thought in cognitive science. Because
              assessments of intelligence (and similar tests of cognitive
              ability) are taken to be the quintessence of good thinking, it
              might be thought that such measures would serve as proxies for
              the assessment of rational thought. It is important to understand
              why such an assumption would be misplaced. It is often not
              recognized that rationality and intelligence (as traditionally
              defined) are two different things conceptually and empirically.
              Distinguishing between rationality and intelligence helps explain
              how people can be, at the same time, intelligent and irrational.
              Thus, individual differences in the cognitive skills that
              underlie rational thinking must be studied in their own right

                   mathematics but also on physics: although well-known
                   mathematical theorems guarantee that neural networks can
                   approximate arbitrary functions well, the class of functions
                   of practical interest can be approximated through ``cheap
                   learning'' with exponentially fewer parameters than generic
                   ones, because they have simplifying properties tracing back
                   to the laws of physics. The exceptional simplicity of
                   physics-based functions hinges on properties such as
                   symmetry, locality, compositionality and polynomial
                   log-probability, and we explore how these properties
                   translate into exceptionally simple neural networks
                   approximating both natural phenomena such as images and
                   abstract representations thereof such as drawings. We
                   further argue that when the statistical process generating
                   the data is of a certain hierarchical form prevalent in
                   physics and machine-learning, a deep neural network can be
                   more efficient than a shallow one. We formalize these claims
                   using information theory and discuss the relation to
                   renormalization group procedures. Various ``no-flattening

                   accurately approximated by shallow ones without efficiency

                   that it applies to all paddable languages, but still does
                   not conflict with potential worst case intractability. Note
                   that the family of paddable languages apparently includes
                   all known natural NP-complete problems. We call our concept
                   Roughly Polynomial Time (RoughP). A language $L,$ over an at
                   least 2-symbol alphabet, is in RoughP, if the following
                   hold: (1) there exists a bijective encoding
                   $\textbackslash{}alpha$ of strings, such that both
                   $\textbackslash{}alpha$ and its inverse are computable in
                   polynomial time; (2) there is a polynomial time algorithm
                   $\textbackslash{}cal A$, which is an errorless heuristic for
                   $L,$ with exponentially vanishing failure rate relative to
                   the $\textbackslash{}alpha$-spheres
                   $S^\{(\textbackslash{}alpha)\}_n=\textbackslash{}\{\textbackslash{}alpha(x)\textbackslash{},|\textbackslash{};\textbackslash{},
                   |x|=n\textbackslash{}\}$. It means, $\textbackslash{}cal A$
                   always correctly decides whether $x\textbackslash{}in L$ or
                   $x\textbackslash{}notin L$, whenever it outputs a decision.
                   For some inputs, however, it may not output a decision,
                   rather it may return a special sign, meaning ``don't know.''
                   But the latter can happen only on an exponentially small
                   fraction of each $\textbackslash{}alpha$-sphere. We prove
                   that RoughP contains all paddable languages. This may
                   contribute to the explanation of the often observed gap
                   between practical algorithm performance and theoretical
                   worst case analysis for hard problems. Furthermore, the
                   proof also provides a general method to construct the
                   desired encoding and the errorless heuristic. Additionally,
                   we also show how to use it for efficiently generating large,

                   any paddable language, including all known natural
                   NP-complete problems. In fact, it appears that every
                   practical decision task (whether in NP or not) can be
                   represented by paddable languages, and, therefore, our
                   RoughP framework applies to all of them. We also explore
                   some connections between RoughP and other complexity

  abstract = "Abstract How should the Fermi paradox affect an estimate of
              humankind’s likelihood and best means of long-term survival? A
              significant probability that many other civilizations have been
              in our situation but failed to become spacefaring increases the
              probability that our optimal existential risk strategies are
              costly, likely to fail, likely to leave traces if they do fail,
              and might require talents that mankind has but that other
              scientifically advanced species lack. The Fermi paradox implies
              that we should seek scientific data based on astronomical
              observations not accessible to civilizations that lived in the
              distant past, and that we should create machines to flood our
              galaxy with radio signals conditional on our civilization’s
              collapse. Our ability to use Bayesian updating on the Fermi
              paradox reduces the chance that aliens exist but are hiding from
              us because of their desire to not interfere in our development:
              giving us a false understanding of the fate of intelligent life
              in the universe would cloud our understanding of existential
              risks. The paradox also provides clues as to types of trap that
              might destroy us. The possibility that our universe is fine-tuned

              searches",
  author   = "Maccone, Claudio",
  abstract = "Abstract In 2013, MIT astrophysicist Sara Seager introduced what
              is now called the Seager Equation (Refs. [20,21]): it expresses
              the number N of exoplanets with detectable signs of life as the
              product of six factors: Ns=the number of stars observed, fQ=the
              fraction of stars that are quiet, fHZ=the fraction of stars with
              rocky planets in the Habitable Zone, fO=the fraction of those
              planets that can be observed, fL=the fraction that have life,
              fS=the fraction on which life produces a detectable signature
              gas. This we call the ``classical Seager equation''. Now suppose
              that each input of that equation is a positive random variable,
              rather than a sheer positive number. As such, each input random
              variable has a positive mean value and a positive variance that
              we assume to be numerically known by scientists. This we call the
              ``Statistical Seager Equation''. Taking the logs of both sides of
              the Statistical Seager Equation, the latter is converted into an
              equation of the type log(N)=SUM of independent random variables.
              Let us now consider the possibility that, in the future, the
              number of physical inputs considered by Seager when she proposed
              her equation will actually increase, since scientists will know
              more and more details about the astrophysics of exoplanets. In
              the limit for an infinite number of inputs, i.e. an infinite
              number of independent input random variables, the Central Limit
              Theorem (CLT) of Statistics applies to the Statistical Seager
              Equation. Thus, the probability density function (pdf) of the
              output random variable log(N) will approach a Gaussian (normal)
              distribution in the limit, whatever the distribution of the input
              random variables might possibly be. But if log(N) approaches the
              normal distribution, then N approaches the lognormal
              distribution, whose mean value is the sum of the input mean
              values and whose variance is the sum of the input variances. This
              is just what this author realized back in 2008 when he
              transformed the Classical Drake Equation into the Statistical
              Drake Equation (Refs. [10,11]). This discovery led to much more
              related work in the following years (Refs. [12--19]). In this
              paper we study the lognormal properties of the Statistical Seager
              Equation relating them to the present and future knowledge for
              exoplanets searches from both the ground and space.",

                   cometary fragments in a highly elliptical orbit (Marengo et

                   8462852 indicative of extraterrestrial intelligence. The
                   primary observations were in the visible optical regime
                   using the Boquete Optical SETI Observatory in Panama. In
                   addition, as a preparatory exercise for the possible future
                   detection of a candidate signal (Heidmann 1991), three of
                   six observing runs simultaneously searched radio frequencies
                   at the Allen Telescope Array in California. No periodic
                   optical signals greater than 67 photons/m2 within a time
                   frame of 25 ns were seen. This limit corresponds to

                   180 - 300 Jy Hz at 1 and 8 GHz, respectively, corresponding
                   to a transmitter with an effective isotropic radiated power
                   of 4E15 W (and 7E15 W) at the distance of KIC 8462852. While
                   these powers requirements are high, even modest targeting

                   single comet of similar size to those in our solar system
                   produces a transit depth of the order of $10^\{-3\}$ lasting
                   less than a day which is much smaller and shorter than the
                   largest dip observed
                   ($\textbackslash{}sim20\textbackslash{}\%$ for
                   $\textbackslash{}sim3$ days), but a large, closely traveling
                   cluster of comets can fit the observed depths and durations.
                   We find that a series of large comet swarms, with all but
                   one on the same orbit, provides a good fit for the KIC
                   8462852 data during Quarters 16 and 17, but does not explain
                   the large dip observed during Quarter 8. However, the
                   transit dips only loosely constrain the orbits and can be
                   fit by swarms with periastrons differing by a factor of 10.
                   To reach a transit depth of $\textbackslash{}sim0.2$, the

                   through 2000 March. R-band lightcurves were obtained on 11
                   of these nights from 1999 April through 1999 June, prior to
                   both the onset of significant coma activity and perihelion.
                   Phasing of the data yields a double-peaked lightcurve and
                   indicates a nucleus rotational period of 8.941 +/- 0.002 hr
                   with a peak-to-peak amplitude of ~0.75 mag. Our data are
                   sufficient to rule out all other possible double-peaked
                   solutions as well as the single- and triple- peaked
                   solutions. This rotation period agrees with one of five
                   possible solutions found in post-perihelion data from 1994
                   by Mueller and Ferrin (1996, Icarus, 123, 463-477), and
                   unambiguously eliminates their remaining four solutions. We
                   applied our same techniques to published lightcurves from
                   1988 which were obtained at an equivalent orbital position
                   and viewing geometry as in 1999. We found a rotation period
                   of 8.932 +/- 0.001 hr in 1988, consistent with the findings
                   of previous authors and incompatible with our 1999 solution.
                   This reveals that Tempel 2 spun-down by ~32 s between 1988
                   and 1999 (two intervening perihelion passages). If the
                   spin-down is due to a systematic torque, then the rotation
                   period prior to perihelion during the 2010 apparition is
                   expected to be an additional 32 s longer than in 1999.",

                   from 2010 September to 2011 January. This rotation period is
                   longer than the period we previously measured in 1999, which
                   was itself longer than the period measured in 1988. A nearly
                   linear jet was observed which varied little during a
                   rotation cycle in both R and CN images acquired during the
                   1999 and 2010 apparitions. We measured the projected
                   direction of this jet throughout the two apparitions and,
                   under the assumption that the source region of the jet was
                   near the comet's pole, determined a rotational pole
                   direction of RA/Dec = 151deg/+59deg from CN measurements and
                   RA/Dec = 173deg/+57deg from dust measurements (we estimate a
                   circular uncertainty of 3deg for CN and 4deg for dust).
                   Different combinations of effects likely bias both gas and
                   dust solutions and we elected to average these solutions for
                   a final pole of RA/Dec = 162 +/- 11deg/+58 +/- 1deg.

                   1999/2000, and 2010/2011. The activity exhibited a steep
                   turn-on ~3 months prior to perihelion (the exact timing of
                   which varies) and a relatively smooth decline after
                   perihelion. The activity during the 1999 and 2010
                   apparitions was similar; limited data in 1983 and 1988 were
                   systematically higher and the difference cannot be explained
                   entirely by the smaller perihelion distance. We measured a
                   ``typical'' composition, in agreement with previous
                   investigators. Monte Carlo numerical modeling with our pole
                   solution best replicated the observed coma morphology for a
                   source region located near a comet latitude of +80deg and
                   having a radius of ~10deg. Our model reproduced the seasonal
                   changes in activity, suggesting that the majority of Tempel

                   stars, the first (and likely only) information will come
                   from the spectroscopic characterization of the planet's
                   atmosphere. Of the countless number of chemical species
                   terrestrial life produces, only a few have the distinct
                   spectral features and the necessary atmospheric abundance to
                   be detectable. The easiest of these species to observe in
                   Earth's atmosphere is O$_\{2\}$ (and its photochemical
                   byproduct, O$_\{3\}$). But O$_\{2\}$ can also be produced
                   abiotically by photolysis of CO$_\{2\}$, followed by
                   recombination of O atoms with each other. CO is produced in
                   stoichiometric proportions. Whether O$_\{2\}$ and CO can
                   accumulate to appreciable concentrations depends on the
                   ratio of far-UV to near-UV radiation coming from the
                   planet's parent star and on what happens to these gases when
                   they dissolve in a planet's oceans. Using a one-dimensional
                   photochemical model, we demonstrate that O$_\{2\}$ derived
                   from CO$_\{2\}$ photolysis should not accumulate to
                   measurable concentrations on planets around F- and G-type
                   stars. K-star, and especially M-star planets, however, may
                   build up O$_\{2\}$ because of the low near-UV flux from
                   their parent stars, in agreement with some previous studies.
                   On such planets, a 'false positive' for life is possible if
                   recombination of dissolved CO and O$_\{2\}$ in the oceans is
                   slow and if other O$_\{2\}$ sinks (e.g., reduced volcanic
                   gases or dissolved ferrous iron) are small. O$_\{3\}$, on
                   the other hand, could be detectable at UV wavelengths

                   literature describes how to characterize such planets with
                   spectroscopy, but less consideration has been given to the
                   usefulness of planet colors. Here, we investigate whether
                   potentially Earth-like exoplanets could be identified using
                   UV-visible-to-NIR wavelength broadband photometry (350-1000
                   nm). Specifically, we calculate optimal photometric bins for
                   identifying an exo-Earth and distinguishing it from
                   uninhabitable planets including both Solar System objects
                   and model exoplanets. The color of some hypothetical
                   exoplanets - particularly icy terrestrial worlds with thick
                   atmospheres - is similar to Earth's because of Rayleigh
                   scattering in the blue region of the spectrum. Nevertheless,
                   subtle features in Earth's reflectance spectrum appear to be
                   unique. In particular, Earth's reflectance spectrum has a
                   'U-shape' unlike all our hypothetical, uninhabitable
                   planets. This shape is partly biogenic because O2-rich,
                   oxidizing air is transparent to sunlight, allowing prominent
                   Rayleigh scattering, while ozone absorbs visible light,
                   creating the bottom of the 'U'. Whether such uniqueness has
                   practical utility depends on observational noise. If
                   observations are photon limited or dominated by
                   astrophysical sources (zodiacal light or imperfect starlight
                   suppression), then the use of broadband visible wavelength
                   photometry to identify Earth twins has little practical
                   advantage over obtaining detailed spectra. However, if
                   observations are dominated by dark current then optimized
                   photometry could greatly assist preliminary
                   characterization. We also calculate the optimal photometric
                   bins for identifying extrasolar Archean Earths, and find
                   that the Archean Earth is more difficult to unambiguously
                   identify than a modern Earth twin.",

                   Proxima Centauri b to identify environmental factors that
                   affect its long-term habitability. We consider physical
                   processes acting on size scales ranging between the galactic
                   scale, the scale of the stellar system, and the scale of the
                   planet's core. We find that there is a significant
                   probability that Proxima Centauri has had encounters with
                   its companion stars, Alpha Centauri A and B, that are close
                   enough to destabilize Proxima Centauri's planetary system.
                   If the system has an additional planet, as suggested by the
                   discovery data, then it may perturb planet b's eccentricity
                   and inclination, possibly driving those parameters to
                   non-zero values, even in the presence of strong tidal
                   damping. We also model the internal evolution of the planet,
                   evaluating the roles of different radiogenic abundances and
                   tidal heating and find that a planet with chondritic
                   abundance may not generate a magnetic field, but all other
                   models do maintain a magnetic field. We find that if planet
                   b formed in situ, then it experienced ~160 million years in
                   a runaway greenhouse as the star contracted during its
                   formation. This early phase may have permanently desiccated
                   the planet and/or produced a large abiotic oxygen
                   atmosphere. On the other hand, if Proxima Centauri b formed
                   with a thin hydrogen atmosphere (<1\% of the planet's mass),
                   then this envelope could have shielded the water long enough
                   for it to be retained before being blown off itself. Through
                   modeling a wide range of Proxima b's evolutionary processes
                   we identify pathways for planet b to be habitable and
                   conclude that water retention is the biggest obstacle for
                   planet b's habitability. These results are all obtained with

                   could have generated different environments that may or may
                   not be habitable. Here we use 1D coupled
                   climate-photochemical models to generate self-consistent
                   atmospheres for evolutionary scenarios predicted in our
                   companion paper (Barnes et al., 2016). These include
                   high-O2, high-CO2, and more Earth-like atmospheres, with
                   either oxidizing or reducing compositions. We show that
                   these modeled environments can be habitable or uninhabitable

                   instrument models to explore our ability to discriminate
                   between possible planetary states. These results are
                   applicable not only to Proxima Cen b, but to other
                   terrestrial planets orbiting M dwarfs. Thermal phase curves
                   may provide the first constraint on the existence of an
                   atmosphere, and JWST observations longward of 7 microns
                   could characterize atmospheric heat transport and molecular
                   composition. Detection of ocean glint is unlikely with JWST,
                   but may be within the reach of larger aperture telescopes.
                   Direct imaging spectra may detect O4, which is diagnostic of
                   massive water loss and O2 retention, rather than a
                   photosynthesis. Similarly, strong CO2 and CO bands at
                   wavelengths shortward of 2.5 \{\textbackslash{}mu\}m would
                   indicate a CO2-dominated atmosphere. If the planet is
                   habitable and volatile-rich, direct imaging will be the best
                   means of detecting habitability. Earth-like planets with

                   physical constants, dimensionality and particle content.
                   Level III: In unitary quantum mechanics, other branches of

                 national malaria programmes universally distribute
                 long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets (LLINs). LLINs
                 provide effective insecticide protection for at least three
                 years while conventional nets must be retreated every 6-12
                 months. LLINs may also promise longer physical durability
                 (lifespan), but at a higher unit price. No prospective data
                 currently available is sufficient to calculate the comparative
                 cost effectiveness of different net types. We thus constructed
                 a model to explore the cost effectiveness of LLINs, asking how
                 a longer lifespan affects the relative cost effectiveness of
                 nets, and if, when and why LLINs might be preferred to
                 conventional insecticide-treated nets. An innovation of our
                 model is that we also considered the replenishment need i.e.
                 loss of nets over time. METHODS: We modelled the choice of net
                 over a 10-year period to facilitate the comparison of nets
                 with different lifespan (and/or price) and replenishment need
                 over time. Our base case represents a large-scale programme
                 which achieves high coverage and usage throughout the
                 population by distributing either LLINs or conventional nets
                 through existing health services, and retreats a large
                 proportion of conventional nets regularly at low cost. We
                 identified the determinants of bed net programme cost
                 effectiveness and parameter values for usage rate, delivery
                 and retreatment cost from the literature. One-way sensitivity
                 analysis was conducted to explicitly compare the differential
                 effect of changing parameters such as price, lifespan, usage
                 and replenishment need. RESULTS: If conventional and
                 long-lasting bed nets have the same physical lifespan (3
                 years), LLINs are more cost effective unless they are priced
                 at more than USD 1.5 above the price of conventional nets.
                 Because a longer lifespan brings delivery cost savings, each
                 one year increase in lifespan can be accompanied by a USD 1 or
                 more increase in price without the cheaper net (of the same
                 type) becoming more cost effective. Distributing replenishment
                 nets each year in addition to the replacement of all nets
                 every 3-4 years increases the number of under-5 deaths averted
                 by 5-14\% at a cost of USD 17-25 per additional person
                 protected per annum or USD 1080-1610 per additional under-5
                 death averted. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the World
                 Health Organization recommendation to distribute only LLINs,
                 while giving guidance on the price thresholds above which this
                 recommendation will no longer hold. Programme planners should
                 be willing to pay a premium for nets which have a longer
                 physical lifespan, and if planners are willing to pay USD 1600
                 per under-5 death averted, investing in replenishment is cost
                 effective.",

              the difference in provided effort disappears. Individuals

  abstract  = "Utilitarian versus deontological inclinations have been studied
               extensively in the field of moral psychology. However, the field
               has been lacking a thorough psychometric evaluation of the most
               commonly used measures. In this paper, we examine the factorial
               structure of an often used set of 12 moral dilemmas purportedly
               measuring utilitarian/deontological moral inclinations. We ran
               three different studies (and a pilot) to investigate the issue.
               In Study 1, we used standard Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)
               and Schmid-Leimann (g factor) analysis; results of which
               informed the a priori single-factor model for our second study.
               Results of Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) in Study 2 were
               replicated in Study 3. Finally, we ran a weak invariance
               analysis between the models of Study 2 and 3, concluding that
               there is no significant difference between factor loading in
               these studies. We find reason to support a single-factor model
               of utilitarian/deontological inclinations. In addition, certain
               dilemmas have consistent error covariance, suggesting that this
               should be taken into consideration in future studies. In
               conclusion, three studies, pilot and an invariance analysis,
               systematically suggest the following. 1) No item needs to be
               dropped from the scale. 2) There is a unidimensional structure
               for utilitarian/deontological preferences behind the most often
               used dilemmas in moral psychology, suggesting a single latent
               cognitive mechanism. 3) The most common set of dilemmas in moral
               psychology can be successfully used as a unidimensional measure
               of utilitarian/deontological moral inclinations, but would
               benefit from using weighted averages over simple averages. 4)

                   world is to predict how its actions affect objects in its
                   environment. Many existing methods for learning the dynamics
                   of physical interactions require labeled object information.
                   However, to scale real-world interaction learning to a
                   variety of scenes and objects, acquiring labeled data
                   becomes increasingly impractical. To learn about physical
                   object motion without labels, we develop an
                   action-conditioned video prediction model that explicitly
                   models pixel motion, by predicting a distribution over pixel
                   motion from previous frames. Because our model explicitly
                   predicts motion, it is partially invariant to object
                   appearance, enabling it to generalize to previously unseen
                   objects. To explore video prediction for real-world
                   interactive agents, we also introduce a dataset of 50,000
                   robot interactions involving pushing motions, including a
                   test set with novel objects. In this dataset, accurate
                   prediction of videos conditioned on the robot's future
                   actions amounts to learning a ``visual imagination'' of
                   different futures based on different courses of action. Our

                   and has versatile actuators (such as arms and fingers), will
                   in principle have the ability to self-modify -- for example
                   by changing its own source code. As we continue to create
                   more and more intelligent agents, chances increase that they
                   will learn about this ability. The question is: will they
                   want to use it? For example, highly intelligent systems may
                   find ways to change their goals to something more easily
                   achievable, thereby `escaping' the control of their
                   designers. In an important paper, Omohundro (2008) argued

                   neural networks, one setting that presents a persistent

                   gradient-based networks require a lot of data to learn,
                   often through extensive iterative training. When new data is
                   encountered, the models must inefficiently relearn their

                   augmented memory capacities, such as Neural Turing Machines
                   (NTMs), offer the ability to quickly encode and retrieve new
                   information, and hence can potentially obviate the downsides

                   In machine learning, however, artificial neural networks
                   tend to eschew precisely designed codes, dynamics or
                   circuits in favor of brute force optimization of a cost
                   function, often using simple and relatively uniform initial
                   architectures. Two recent developments have emerged within
                   machine learning that create an opportunity to connect these
                   seemingly divergent perspectives. First, structured
                   architectures are used, including dedicated systems for
                   attention, recursion and various forms of short- and
                   long-term memory storage. Second, cost functions and
                   training procedures have become more complex and are varied
                   across layers and over time. Here we think about the brain
                   in terms of these ideas. We hypothesize that (1) the brain
                   optimizes cost functions, (2) these cost functions are
                   diverse and differ across brain locations and over

                   studying intelligent behaviour, with applications ranging
                   from artificial intelligence to psychology and economics.
                   AIXI is a universal solution to the RL problem; it can learn
                   any computable environment. A technical subtlety of AIXI is
                   that it is defined using a mixture over semimeasures that
                   need not sum to 1, rather than over proper probability
                   measures. In this work we argue that the shortfall of a
                   semimeasure can naturally be interpreted as the agent's
                   estimate of the probability of its death. We formally define
                   death for generally intelligent agents like AIXI, and prove
                   a number of related theorems about their behaviour. Notable
                   discoveries include that agent behaviour can change
                   radically under positive linear transformations of the
                   reward signal (from suicidal to dogmatically
                   self-preserving), and that the agent's posterior belief that
                   it will survive increases over time.",

                   agents? Reinforcement learning (RL) is a natural approach.
                   Unfortunately, RL does not work well for generally
                   intelligent agents, as RL agents are incentivised to
                   shortcut the reward sensor for maximum reward -- the
                   so-called wireheading problem. In this paper we suggest an
                   alternative to RL called value reinforcement learning (VRL).
                   In VRL, agents use the reward signal to learn a utility
                   function. The VRL setup allows us to remove the incentive to
                   wirehead by placing a constraint on the agent's actions. The
                   constraint is defined in terms of the agent's belief

  abstract    = "The human brain has often been viewed as outstanding among
                 mammalian brains: the most cognitively able, the
                 largest-than-expected from body size, endowed with an
                 overdeveloped cerebral cortex that represents over 80\% of
                 brain mass, and purportedly containing 100 billion neurons and
                 10x more glial cells. Such uniqueness was seemingly necessary
                 to justify the superior cognitive abilities of humans over
                 larger-brained mammals such as elephants and whales. However,
                 our recent studies using a novel method to determine the
                 cellular composition of the brain of humans and other primates
                 as well as of rodents and insectivores show that, since
                 different cellular scaling rules apply to the brains within
                 these orders, brain size can no longer be considered a proxy
                 for the number of neurons in the brain. These studies also
                 showed that the human brain is not exceptional in its cellular
                 composition, as it was found to contain as many neuronal and
                 non-neuronal cells as would be expected of a primate brain of
                 its size. Additionally, the so-called overdeveloped human
                 cerebral cortex holds only 19\% of all brain neurons, a
                 fraction that is similar to that found in other mammals. In
                 what regards absolute numbers of neurons, however, the human
                 brain does have two advantages compared to other mammalian
                 brains: compared to rodents, and probably to whales and
                 elephants as well, it is built according to the very
                 economical, space-saving scaling rules that apply to other
                 primates; and, among economically built primate brains, it is
                 the largest, hence containing the most neurons. These findings
                 argue in favor of a view of cognitive abilities that is
                 centered on absolute numbers of neurons, rather than on body
                 size or encephalization, and call for a re-examination of
                 several concepts related to the exceptionality of the human

                   we extend the idea of Freeman Dyson considering pulsars
                   instead of stars. It is shown that instead of a spherical
                   shell the supercivilization must use ring-like
                   constructions. We have found that a size of the ``ring''
                   should be of the order of $(10^\{-4\}-10^\{-1\})$AU with
                   temperature interval $(300-600)$K for relatively slowly
                   rotating pulsars and $(10-350)$AU with temperature interval
                   $(300-700)$K for rapidly spinning neutron stars,
                   respectively. Although for the latter the Dyson construction
                   is unrealistically massive and cannot be considered
                   seriously. Analyzing the stresses in terms of the radiation
                   and wind flows it has been argued that they cannot
                   significantly affect the ring construction. On the other
                   hand, the ring in-plane unstable equilibrium can be restored
                   by the energy which is small compared to the energy
                   extracted from the star. This indicates that the search for

                 measured rim thicknesses. Maximum rim growth times span from
                 ~1 min to 35 years, with a median of ~4 days. More than 70\%
                 of rim growth times are less than 1 year, showing that quartz
                 rims have mostly grown in the days to months prior to
                 eruption. Minimum growth rates show distinct modes between
                 10-8 and 10-10 m/s (depending on sample), revealing very fast
                 crystal growth rates (100s of nm to 10s of $\mu$m per day).
                 Our data show that quartz rims grew well within a year of
                 eruption, with most of the growth happening in the weeks or
                 days preceding eruption. Growth took place under conditions of
                 high supersaturation, suggesting that rim growth marks the
                 onset of decompression and the transition from pre-eruptive to
                 syn-eruptive conditions.",

                 when facing the temptation to act unethically, we often cross

                 people engage in unethical behavior over time by suggesting
                 that their memory for their past unethical actions is
                 impaired. We propose that, after engaging in unethical
                 behavior, individuals' memories of their actions become more
                 obfuscated over time because of the psychological distress and
                 discomfort such misdeeds cause. In nine studies (n = 2,109),
                 we show that engaging in unethical behavior produces changes
                 in memory so that memories of unethical actions gradually

                 in the subsequent 12 years. EBM has become far more recognized
                 and adopted in many places, but not everywhere, for example,
                 it never acquired much influence in the USA. As EBM became
                 more influential, it was also hijacked to serve agendas
                 different from what it originally aimed for. Influential
                 randomized trials are largely done by and for the benefit of
                 the industry. Meta-analyses and guidelines have become a
                 factory, mostly also serving vested interests. National and

                   intelligence that have been given by experts, and extract
                   their essential features. These are then mathematically

                   captures the concept of machine intelligence in the broadest
                   reasonable sense. We then show how this formal definition is
                   related to the theory of universal optimal learning agents.

                   function of the information contained in the replicator, and
                   the environmental conditions that might enable this

                   assumptions) the probability to discover a self-replicator
                   by chance depends exponentially on the rate of formation of

                   somewhat similar to the rate at which they would occur in a

                 health care legislation enacted in the United States since the
                 creation of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. The law implemented
                 comprehensive reforms designed to improve the accessibility,
                 affordability, and quality of health care. Objectives: To
                 review the factors influencing the decision to pursue health
                 reform, summarize evidence on the effects of the law to date,
                 recommend actions that could improve the health care system,
                 and identify general lessons for public policy from the
                 Affordable Care Act. Evidence: Analysis of publicly available
                 data, data obtained from government agencies, and published
                 research findings. The period examined extends from 1963 to
                 early 2016. Findings: The Affordable Care Act has made
                 significant progress toward solving long-standing challenges
                 facing the US health care system related to access,
                 affordability, and quality of care. Since the Affordable Care
                 Act became law, the uninsured rate has declined by 43\%, from
                 16.0\% in 2010 to 9.1\% in 2015, primarily because of the
                 law's reforms. Research has documented accompanying
                 improvements in access to care (for example, an estimated
                 reduction in the share of nonelderly adults unable to afford
                 care of 5.5 percentage points), financial security (for

                 nonelderly adults reporting fair or poor health of 3.4
                 percentage points). The law has also begun the process of
                 transforming health care payment systems, with an estimated
                 30\% of traditional Medicare payments now flowing through
                 alternative payment models like bundled payments or
                 accountable care organizations. These and related reforms have
                 contributed to a sustained period of slow growth in
                 per-enrollee health care spending and improvements in health
                 care quality. Despite this progress, major opportunities to
                 improve the health care system remain. Conclusions and
                 Relevance: Policy makers should build on progress made by the
                 Affordable Care Act by continuing to implement the Health
                 Insurance Marketplaces and delivery system reform, increasing
                 federal financial assistance for Marketplace enrollees,
                 introducing a public plan option in areas lacking individual
                 market competition, and taking actions to reduce prescription
                 drug costs. Although partisanship and special interest
                 opposition remain, experience with the Affordable Care Act
                 demonstrates that positive change is achievable on some of the
                 nation's most complex challenges.",

              to commit mass killing than nonrevolutionary leaders.
              Revolutionary leaders are more ideologically committed to
              transforming society, more risk tolerant, and more likely to view
              the use of violence as appropriate and effective. Furthermore,
              such leaders tend to command highly disciplined and loyal
              organizations, built in the course of revolutionary struggles,
              that can perpetrate mass killing. This study uses time series
              cross-sectional data from 1955 to 2004 to demonstrate that
              revolutionary leaders are more likely to initiate genocide or
              politicide than nonrevolutionary leaders. The violent behaviors
              of revolutionary leaders are not limited to the immediate
              postrevolutionary years but also occur later in their tenure.
              This demonstrates that the association of revolutionary leaders
              and mass killing is not simply indicative of postrevolutionary
              instability. This article also provides evidence for the

  abstract = "Imagine that you and a duplicate of yourself are lying
              unconscious, next to each other, about to undergo a complete
              step‐by‐step exchange of bits of your bodies. It certainly seems
              that at no stage in this exchange of bits will you have thereby
              switched places with your duplicate. Yet it also seems that the
              end‐result, with all the bits exchanged, will be essentially that
              of the two of you having switched places. Where will you awaken?
              I claim that one and the same person possesses both bodies,
              occupies both places and will experience both awakenings, just as
              a person whose brain has been bisected must at once experience
              both of the unconnected fields of awareness, even though each of
              these will falsely appear to him as the entirety of his
              experience. I also claim that the more usual apparent boundaries
              of persons are as illusory as those in brain bisection; personal
              identity remains unchanged through any variation or
              multiplication of body or mind. In all conscious life there is
              only one person ‐ I ‐ whose existence depends merely on the
              presence of a quality that is inherent in all experience ‐ its
              quality of being mine, the simple immediacy of it for whatever is
              having experience. One powerful argument for this is statistical:
              on the ordinary view of personhood it is an incredible
              coincidence for you (though not for others) that out of
              200,000,000 sperm cells the very one required on each occasion
              for your future existence was first to the egg in each of the
              begettings of yourself and all your ancestors. The only view that
              does not make your existence incredible, and that is not
              therefore (from your perspective) an incredible view, is that any
              conscious being would necessarily have been you anyway. It is a
              consequence that self‐interest should extend to all conscious

               reasoning from explicitly understood principles? We address this
               question by investigating one particular moral principle, the
               principle of the double effect. Using web-based technology, we
               collected a large data set on individuals’ responses to a series
               of moral dilemmas, asking when harm to innocent others is
               permissible. Each moral dilemma presented a choice between
               action and inaction, both resulting in lives saved and lives
               lost. Results showed that: (1) patterns of moral judgments were
               consistent with the principle of double effect and showed little
               variation across differences in gender, age, educational level,
               ethnicity, religion or national affiliation (within the limited

               failed to provide justifications that could account for their
               judgments. These results indicate that the principle of the
               double effect may be operative in our moral judgments but not
               open to conscious introspection. We discuss these results in
               light of current psychological theories of moral cognition,

                   and harmful behavior that may emerge from poor design of
                   real-world AI systems. We present a list of five practical
                   research problems related to accident risk, categorized
                   according to whether the problem originates from having the
                   wrong objective function (``avoiding side effects'' and

  abstract      = "The fermi paradox uses an appeal to the mediocrity principle
                   to make it seem counter-intuitive that humanity has not been
                   contacted by extraterrestrial intelligence. A numerical,
                   statistical analysis was conducted to determine whether this
                   apparent loneliness is, in fact, unexpected. An inequality
                   was derived to relate the frequency of life arising and
                   developing technology on a suitable planet in the galaxy,
                   the average length of time since the first broadcast of such
                   a civilization, and a constant term. An analysis of the
                   sphere reached thus far by human communication was also
                   conducted, considering our local neighborhood and planets of
                   particular interest. We clearly show that human
                   communication has not reached a number of stars and planets
                   adequate to expect an answer. These analyses both conclude
                   that the Fermi paradox is not, in fact, unexpected. By the
                   mediocrity principle and numerical modeling, it is actually
                   unlikely that the Earth would have been reached by
                   extraterrestrial communication at this point. We predict
                   that under 1 percent of the galaxy has been reached at all
                   thus far, and we do not anticipate to be reached until
                   approximately half of the stars/planets have been reached.
                   We offer a prediction that we should not expect this until
                   at least 1,500 years in the future. Thus the Fermi paradox
                   is not a shocking observation, and humanity may very well be
                   contacted within our species' lifespan.",

              trended toward the adoption of ``causal empiricist'' approaches.
              Such approaches place heavy emphasis on causal identification
              through experimental and natural experimental designs and on
              characterizing the specific subpopulations for which effects are
              identified. This trend is eroding the position of traditional
              regression studies as the prevailing convention for quantitative
              causal research in political science. This essay clarifies what
              is at stake. I provide a causal empiricist critique of
              conventional regression studies, a statement of core pillars of
              causal empiricism, and a discussion of how causal empiricism and
              theory interact. I propose that the trend toward causal
              empiricism should be welcomed by a broad array of political
              scientists. The trend fits into a broader push to reimagine our

              Conventional languages place conceptual limits on the way
              problems can be modularised. Functional languages push those

              functional languages in particular, higher-order functions and
              lazy evaluation, can contribute greatly to modularity. As
              examples, we manipulate lists and trees, program several
              numerical algorithms, and implement the alpha-beta heuristics (an
              Artificial Intelligence algorithm used in game-playing programs).

  abstract = "Background: Public reporting is seen as a powerful quality
              improvement tool, but data to support its efficacy are limited.
              The Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services' Hospital Compare
              program initially reported process metrics only but started
              reporting mortality rates for acute myocardial infarction, heart
              failure, and pneumonia in 2008. Objective: To determine whether
              public reporting of mortality rates was associated with lower
              mortality rates for these conditions among Medicare
              beneficiaries. Design: For 2005 to 2007, process-only reporting
              was considered; for 2008 to 2012, process and mortality reporting
              was considered. Changes in mortality trends before and during
              reporting periods were estimated by using patient-level
              hierarchical modeling. Nonreported medical conditions were used
              as a secular control. Setting: U.S. acute care hospitals.
              Participants: 20 707 266 fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries
              hospitalized from January 2005 through November 2012.
              Measurements: 30-day risk-adjusted mortality rates. Results:
              Mortality rates for the 3 publicly reported conditions were
              changing at an absolute rate of -0.23\% per quarter during
              process-only reporting, but this change slowed to a rate of
              -0.09\% per quarter during process and mortality reporting
              (change, 0.13\% per quarter; 95\% CI, 0.12\% to 0.14\%).
              Mortality for nonreported conditions was changing at -0.17\% per
              quarter during process-only reporting and slowed slightly to
              -0.11\% per quarter during process and mortality reporting
              (change, 0.06\% per quarter; CI, 0.05\% to 0.07\%). Limitation:
              Administrative data may have limited ability to account for
              changes in patient complexity over time. Conclusion: Changes in
              mortality trends suggest that reporting in Hospital Compare was
              associated with a slowing, rather than an improvement, in the

  abstract      = "Poor research design and data analysis encourage
                   false-positive findings. Such poor methods persist despite
                   perennial calls for improvement, suggesting that they result
                   from something more than just misunderstanding. The
                   persistence of poor methods results partly from incentives
                   that favor them, leading to the natural selection of bad
                   science. This dynamic requires no conscious
                   strategizing---no deliberate cheating nor loafing---by
                   scientists, only that publication is a principle factor for
                   career advancement. Some normative methods of analysis have
                   almost certainly been selected to further publication
                   instead of discovery. In order to improve the culture of
                   science, a shift must be made away from correcting
                   misunderstandings and towards rewarding understanding. We
                   support this argument with empirical evidence and
                   computational modeling. We first present a 60-year
                   meta-analysis of statistical power in the behavioral
                   sciences and show that power has not improved despite
                   repeated demonstrations of the necessity of increasing
                   power. To demonstrate the logical consequences of structural
                   incentives, we then present a dynamic model of scientific
                   communities in which competing laboratories investigate
                   novel or previously published hypotheses using culturally
                   transmitted research methods. As in the real world,
                   successful labs produce more ``progeny'', such that their
                   methods are more often copied and their students are more
                   likely to start labs of their own. Selection for high output
                   leads to poorer methods and increasingly high false
                   discovery rates. We additionally show that replication slows
                   but does not stop the process of methodological
                   deterioration. Improving the quality of research requires
                   change at the institutional level.",

              fundamental insights into the way the brain processes

              simulated classical microprocessor as a model organism, and use
              our ability to perform arbitrary experiments on it to see if
              popular data analysis methods from neuroscience can elucidate the

                 thanks in no small part to Cognition. Consistent with its
                 interdisciplinary tradition, Cognition encouraged the growth
                 of this field by supporting empirical research conducted by
                 philosophers as well as research native to neighboring fields
                 such as social psychology, evolutionary game theory, and
                 behavioral economics. This research has been exceptionally
                 diverse both in its content and methodology. I argue that this
                 is because morality is unified at the functional level, but
                 not at the cognitive level, much as vehicles are unified by
                 shared function rather than shared mechanics. Research in
                 moral cognition, then, has progressed by explaining the
                 phenomena that we identify as ``moral'' (for high-level
                 functional reasons) in terms of diverse cognitive components
                 that are not specific to morality. In light of this, research
                 on moral cognition may continue to flourish, not as the
                 identification and characterization of distinctive moral
                 processes, but as a testing ground for theories of high-level,
                 integrative cognitive function.",

                 activity. The spine heads and neck diameters, but not neck

@ARTICLE{Goertzel2015-cn,
  title    = "Superintelligence: Fears, Promises and Potentials",
  author   = "Goertzel, Ben",
  abstract = "Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom, in his recent and celebrated
              book Superintelligence, argues that advanced AI poses a
              potentially major existential risk to humanity, and that advanced
              AI development should be heavily regulated and perhaps even
              restricted to a small set of government-approved researchers.
              Bostrom’s ideas and arguments are reviewed and explored in
              detail, and compared with the thinking of three other current
              thinkers on the nature and implications of AI: Eliezer Yudkowsky
              of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (formerly
              Singularity Institute for AI), and David Weinbaum (Weaver) and
              Viktoras Veitas of the Global Brain Institute. Relevant portions
              of Yudkowsky’s book Rationality: From AI to Zombies are briefly
              reviewed, and it is found that nearly all the core ideas of
              Bostrom’s work appeared previously or concurrently in Yudkowsky’s
              thinking. However, Yudkowsky often presents these shared ideas in
              a more plain-spoken and extreme form, making clearer the essence
              of what is being claimed. For instance, the elitist strain of
              thinking that one sees in the background in Bostrom is plainly
              and openly articulated in Yudkowsky, with many of the same
              practical conclusions (e.g. that it may well be best if advanced
              AI is developed in secret by a small elite group). Bostrom and
              Yudkowsky view intelligent systems through the lens of
              reinforcement learning -- they view them as ``reward-maximizers''
              and worry about what happens when a very powerful and intelligent
              reward-maximizer is paired with a goal system that gives rewards
              for achieving foolish goals like tiling the universe with
              paperclips. Weinbaum and Veitas’s recent paper ``Open-Ended
              Intelligence'' presents a starkly alternative perspective on
              intelligence, viewing it as centered not on reward maximization,
              but rather on complex self-organization and self-transcending
              development that occurs in close coupling with a complex
              environment that is also ongoingly self-organizing, in only
              partially knowable ways. It is concluded that Bostrom and
              Yudkowsky’s arguments for existential risk have some logical
              foundation, but are often presented in an exaggerated way. For
              instance, formal arguments whose implication is that the ``worst
              case scenarios'' for advanced AI development are extremely dire,

                 be more intelligent than 'lower' mammals, the great apes and
                 humans more than monkeys, and humans more than the great apes.
                 Brain properties assumed to be relevant for intelligence are
                 the (absolute or relative) size of the brain, cortex,
                 prefrontal cortex and degree of encephalization. However,
                 factors that correlate better with intelligence are the number
                 of cortical neurons and conduction velocity, as the basis for
                 information-processing capacity. Humans have more cortical
                 neurons than other mammals, although only marginally more than
                 whales and elephants. The outstanding intelligence of humans

  abstract = "It is common to summarize statistical comparisons by declarations
              of statistical significance or nonsignificance. Here we discuss
              one problem with such declarations, namely that changes in
              statistical significance are often not themselves statistically
              significant. By this, we are not merely making the commonplace
              observation that any particular threshold is arbitrary---for
              example, only a small change is required to move an estimate from
              a 5.1\% significance level to 4.9\%, thus moving it into
              statistical significance. Rather, we are pointing out that even
              large changes in significance levels can correspond to small,
              nonsignificant changes in the underlying quantities.The error we
              describe is conceptually different from other oft-cited
              problems---that statistical significance is not the same as
              practical importance, that dichotomization into significant and
              nonsignificant results encourages the dismissal of observed
              differences in favor of the usually less interesting null
              hypothesis of no difference, and that any particular threshold
              for declaring significance is arbitrary. We are troubled by all
              of these concerns and do not intend to minimize their importance.
              Rather, our goal is to bring attention to this additional error
              of interpretation. We illustrate with a theoretical example and
              two applied examples. The ubiquity of this statistical error
              leads us to suggest that students and practitioners be made more
              aware that the difference between ``significant'' and ``not

              a cognitive struggle between two systems in the brain: the
              emotional ``hot'' system and the rational ``cold'' system. Past
              research has shown that when presented with personal dilemmas,
              individuals showed greater brain activity in the hot system
              areas. However, when further probed about their decisions, moral
              dumbfounding often occurs. Family selection may help explain
              moral judgments. Oftentimes, people consider their pets as part
              of their family. Based on the past research on moral
              decision-making, the current study presented a novel approach to
              exploring moral decision-making by forcing participants to choose
              to save the life between biological family and psychological-kin.
              Participants (n = 573) were given moral dilemmas and forced to
              decide whether to save humans or pets from imminent death. The
              level of relationship between the human shifted six times
              (foreign tourist, hometown stranger, distant cousin, best friend,
              grandparent, and sibling), while relationship to the pet had two
              levels (your pet, someone else's pet). Willingness to save a pet
              over a human consistently decreased as level of relationship
              between the participant and the human in the scenario increased.
              Participants were also more likely to save their own pet over a
              human life than someone else's pet over a human life. The results
              suggest that pets are often viewed as psychological-kin. Females
              were found to be more likely to save their pets over
              non-immediate family members than males (all ps < 0.05),
              suggesting that males and females may differ in the structure of
              their moral reasoning.",

              information, the target regime's consolidation of power

                 with epilepsy, though their exact underlying neural mechanisms
                 are still unclear. Here, we had the rare opportunity to record
                 a delusional religious conversion in real time in a patient
                 with right temporal lobe epilepsy undergoing continuous
                 video-EEG. In this patient, a messianic revelation experience
                 occurred several hours after a complex partial seizure of
                 temporal origin, compatible with postictal psychosis (PIP). We
                 analyzed the recorded resting-state EEG epochs separately for
                 each of the conventional frequency bands. Topographical
                 analysis of the bandpass filtered EEG epochs revealed
                 increased activity in the low-gamma range (30-40Hz) during
                 religious conversion compared with activity during the
                 patient's habitual state. The brain generator underlying this
                 activity was localized to the left prefrontal cortex. This
                 suggests that religious conversion in PIP is related to
                 control mechanisms in the prefrontal lobe-related processes
                 rather than medial temporal lobe-related processes.",

                   I: A generic prediction of inflation is an infinite ergodic
                   universe, which contains Hubble volumes realizing all
                   initial conditions -- including an identical copy of you
                   about 10^(10^29)m away. Level II: In chaotic inflation,
                   other thermalized regions may have different physical
                   constants, dimensionality and particle content. Level III:
                   In unitary quantum mechanics, other branches of the
                   wavefunction add nothing qualitatively new, which is ironic
                   given that this level has historically been the most
                   controversial. Level IV: Other mathematical structures give
                   different fundamental equations of physics. The key question
                   is not whether parallel universes exist (Level I is the
                   uncontroversial cosmological concordance model), but how
                   many levels there are. I discuss how multiverse models can

                 environments and life in our own Solar System, understanding

                 understanding the evolutionary mechanisms and environmental
                 limits of life, determining the principles that will shape
                 life in the future, and recognizing signatures of life on
                 other worlds and on early Earth. For each of these goals,

              to measure cognitive abilities (e.g., Boot, 2015). To that end,
              we wanted to test the feasibility of developing a measure of
              fluid intelligence within a commercially-available video game. We
              created a 15 chamber (i.e., problems to be solved) test called
              the ``Portal 2 Test Battery'' using the Puzzle Creator within the
              popular problem-solving video game Portal 2. In study 1, 35 video
              game players (VGPs) who had experience playing Portal 2 completed
              this test and Ravens Advanced Progressive Matrices (RAPM), a
              validated measure of fluid intelligence, revealing a strong
              relationship (r = .65) between the two. In study 2, 100
              participants, both VGPs and non-video game players (nVGPs)
              completed the Portal 2 Test Battery, RAPM, and the Bochumer
              Matrices Test (BOMAT), another validated measure of fluid
              intelligence. Structure equation modeling revealed a strong
              relationship between the latent variables fluid intelligence and

  abstract    = "How, why, and when consciousness evolved remain hotly debated
                 topics. Addressing these issues requires considering the
                 distribution of consciousness across the animal phylogenetic
                 tree. Here we propose that at least one invertebrate clade,
                 the insects, has a capacity for the most basic aspect of
                 consciousness: subjective experience. In vertebrates the
                 capacity for subjective experience is supported by integrated
                 structures in the midbrain that create a neural simulation of
                 the state of the mobile animal in space. This integrated and
                 egocentric representation of the world from the animal's
                 perspective is sufficient for subjective experience.
                 Structures in the insect brain perform analogous functions.
                 Therefore, we argue the insect brain also supports a capacity
                 for subjective experience. In both vertebrates and insects
                 this form of behavioral control system evolved as an efficient
                 solution to basic problems of sensory reafference and true
                 navigation. The brain structures that support subjective
                 experience in vertebrates and insects are very different from
                 each other, but in both cases they are basal to each clade.
                 Hence we propose the origins of subjective experience can be
                 traced to the Cambrian.",

  abstract    = "Thoughts arise spontaneously in our minds with remarkable
                 frequency, but tracking the brain systems associated with the
                 early inception of a thought has proved challenging. Here we
                 addressed this issue by taking advantage of the heightened
                 introspective ability of experienced mindfulness practitioners
                 to detect the onset of their spontaneously arising thoughts.
                 We observed subtle differences in timing among the many
                 regions typically recruited by spontaneous thought. Only in
                 some of these regions did neural activation peak prior to the
                 spontaneous arising of a thought - most notably in the medial
                 temporal lobe and inferior parietal lobule. In contrast,
                 activation in the medial prefrontal, temporopolar,
                 mid-insular, lateral prefrontal, and dorsal anterior cingulate
                 cortices peaked together with or immediately following the
                 arising of spontaneous thought. We propose that brain regions
                 that show antecedent recruitment may be preferentially
                 involved in the initial inception of spontaneous thoughts,
                 while those that show later recruitment may be preferentially
                 involved in the subsequent elaboration and metacognitive
                 processing of spontaneous thoughts. Our findings highlight the
                 temporal dynamics of neural recruitment surrounding the
                 emergence of spontaneous thoughts and may help account for
                 some of spontaneous thought's peculiar qualities, including
                 its wild diversity of content and its links to memory and
                 attention.",

  abstract      = "While probability theory is normally applied to external
                   environments, there has been some recent interest in
                   probabilistic modeling of the outputs of computations that
                   are too expensive to run. Since mathematical logic is a
                   powerful tool for reasoning about computer programs, we
                   consider this problem from the perspective of integrating
                   probability and logic. Recent work on assigning
                   probabilities to mathematical statements has used the
                   concept of coherent distributions, which satisfy logical
                   constraints such as the probability of a sentence and its
                   negation summing to one. Although there are algorithms which
                   converge to a coherent probability distribution in the
                   limit, this yields only weak guarantees about finite
                   approximations of these distributions. In our setting, this
                   is a significant limitation: Coherent distributions assign
                   probability one to all statements provable in a specific
                   logical theory, such as Peano Arithmetic, which can prove
                   what the output of any terminating computation is; thus, a
                   coherent distribution must assign probability one to the
                   output of any terminating computation. To model uncertainty
                   about computations, we propose to work with approximations
                   to coherent distributions. We introduce uniform coherence, a
                   strengthening of coherence that provides appropriate
                   constraints on finite approximations, and propose an
                   algorithm which satisfies this criterion.",

                 hypothesized to explain distinctive human traits, including
                 exceptionally slow and protracted preadult growth. Although
                 widely assumed to constrain life-history evolution, the
                 metabolic requirements of the growing human brain are unknown.
                 We combined previously collected PET and MRI data to calculate
                 the human brain's glucose use from birth to adulthood, which
                 we compare with body growth rate. We evaluate the strength of
                 brain-body metabolic trade-offs using the ratios of brain
                 glucose uptake to the body's resting metabolic rate (RMR) and
                 daily energy requirements (DER) expressed in glucose-gram
                 equivalents (glucosermr\% and glucoseder\%). We find that
                 glucosermr\% and glucoseder\% do not peak at birth (52.5\% and
                 59.8\% of RMR, or 35.4\% and 38.7\% of DER, for males and
                 females, respectively), when relative brain size is largest,
                 but rather in childhood (66.3\% and 65.0\% of RMR and 43.3\%
                 and 43.8\% of DER). Body-weight growth (dw/dt) and both
                 glucosermr\% and glucoseder\% are strongly, inversely related:
                 soon after birth, increases in brain glucose demand are
                 accompanied by proportionate decreases in dw/dt. Ages of peak
                 brain glucose demand and lowest dw/dt co-occur and subsequent
                 developmental declines in brain metabolism are matched by
                 proportionate increases in dw/dt until puberty. The finding
                 that human brain glucose demands peak during childhood, and
                 evidence that brain metabolism and body growth rate covary
                 inversely across development, support the hypothesis that the
                 high costs of human brain development require compensatory
                 slowing of body growth rate.",

                 primate brains differ from rodent brains in their cellular
                 composition. Here we examine the cellular scaling rules for
                 primate brains and show that brain size increases
                 approximately isometrically as a function of cell numbers,
                 such that an 11x larger brain is built with 10x more neurons
                 and approximately 12x more nonneuronal cells of relatively
                 constant average size. This isometric function is in contrast
                 to rodent brains, which increase faster in size than in
                 numbers of neurons. As a consequence of the linear cellular
                 scaling rules, primate brains have a larger number of neurons

               in terms of reputation and the construction of a moral identity.

                 measurement-level models that fail to consider the effects of
                 measurement (un)reliability. We use intuitive examples, Monte
                 Carlo simulations, and a novel analytical framework to
                 demonstrate that common strategies for establishing
                 incremental construct validity using multiple regression
                 analysis exhibit extremely high Type I error rates under
                 parameter regimes common in many psychological domains.
                 Counterintuitively, we find that error rates are highest-in
                 some cases approaching 100\%-when sample sizes are large and
                 reliability is moderate. Our findings suggest that a
                 potentially large proportion of incremental validity claims

  author   = "Lewicki, Roy J and Polin, Beth and Lount, Robert B",
  abstract = "Violations of trust are an unfortunate but common occurrence in
              conflict and negotiation settings: negotiators make promises that
              they do not keep; parties in conflict behave in unexpected ways,
              escalating tensions and breaking past trust. What often follows
              these violations is some form of an account, specifically an
              apology, in an effort to repair that trust. But are some
              apologies more effective than others? Two studies reported here
              examine the structural components of apologies. Six components of
              an apology were defined from previous research and presented to
              subjects---singly and in combination---in the form of component
              definitions and in the context of a trust violation scenario.
              Results indicate that not all apologies are viewed equally;
              apologies with more components were more effective than those
              with fewer components, and certain components were deemed more
              important than others. Moreover, apologies following
              competence-based trust violations were seen as more effective
              than apologies following integrity-based violations. Implications
              and future directions for research in the structure of effective
              apologies are presented.",

              drug, but its effects on the human brain have never been studied
              before with modern neuroimaging. Here, three complementary
              neuroimaging techniques: arterial spin labeling (ASL), blood
              oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) measures, and
              magnetoencephalography (MEG), implemented during resting state
              conditions, revealed marked changes in brain activity after LSD
              that correlated strongly with its characteristic psychological
              effects. Increased visual cortex cerebral blood flow (CBF),
              decreased visual cortex alpha power, and a greatly expanded
              primary visual cortex (V1) functional connectivity profile
              correlated strongly with ratings of visual hallucinations,
              implying that intrinsic brain activity exerts greater influence
              on visual processing in the psychedelic state, thereby defining
              its hallucinatory quality. LSD’s marked effects on the visual
              cortex did not significantly correlate with the drug’s other
              characteristic effects on consciousness, however. Rather,
              decreased connectivity between the parahippocampus and
              retrosplenial cortex (RSC) correlated strongly with ratings of
              ``ego-dissolution'' and ``altered meaning,'' implying the
              importance of this particular circuit for the maintenance of
              ``self'' or ``ego'' and its processing of ``meaning.'' Strong
              relationships were also found between the different imaging
              metrics, enabling firmer inferences to be made about their
              functional significance. This uniquely comprehensive examination
              of the LSD state represents an important advance in scientific
              research with psychedelic drugs at a time of growing interest in
              their scientific and therapeutic value. The present results
              contribute important new insights into the characteristic
              hallucinatory and consciousness-altering properties of
              psychedelics that inform on how they can model certain
              pathological states and potentially treat others.",

              creepiness, as were some occupations and hobbies. The results are
              consistent with the hypothesis that being ``creeped out'' is an
              evolved adaptive emotional response to ambiguity about the

  abstract    = "Importance: The relationship between income and life
                 expectancy is well established but remains poorly understood.
                 Objectives: To measure the level, time trend, and geographic
                 variability in the association between income and life
                 expectancy and to identify factors related to small area
                 variation. Design and Setting: Income data for the US
                 population were obtained from 1.4 billion deidentified tax
                 records between 1999 and 2014. Mortality data were obtained
                 from Social Security Administration death records. These data
                 were used to estimate race- and ethnicity-adjusted life
                 expectancy at 40 years of age by household income percentile,
                 sex, and geographic area, and to evaluate factors associated
                 with differences in life expectancy. Exposure: Pretax
                 household earnings as a measure of income. Main Outcomes and
                 Measures: Relationship between income and life expectancy;
                 trends in life expectancy by income group; geographic
                 variation in life expectancy levels and trends by income
                 group; and factors associated with differences in life
                 expectancy across areas. Results: The sample consisted of 1
                 408 287 218 person-year observations for individuals aged 40
                 to 76 years (mean age, 53.0 years; median household earnings
                 among working individuals, $61 175 per year). There were 4 114
                 380 deaths among men (mortality rate, 596.3 per 100 000) and 2
                 694 808 deaths among women (mortality rate, 375.1 per 100
                 000). The analysis yielded 4 results. First, higher income was
                 associated with greater longevity throughout the income
                 distribution. The gap in life expectancy between the richest
                 1\% and poorest 1\% of individuals was 14.6 years (95\% CI,
                 14.4 to 14.8 years) for men and 10.1 years (95\% CI, 9.9 to
                 10.3 years) for women. Second, inequality in life expectancy
                 increased over time. Between 2001 and 2014, life expectancy
                 increased by 2.34 years for men and 2.91 years for women in
                 the top 5\% of the income distribution, but by only 0.32 years
                 for men and 0.04 years for women in the bottom 5\% (P < .001
                 for the differences for both sexes). Third, life expectancy
                 for low-income individuals varied substantially across local
                 areas. In the bottom income quartile, life expectancy differed
                 by approximately 4.5 years between areas with the highest and
                 lowest longevity. Changes in life expectancy between 2001 and
                 2014 ranged from gains of more than 4 years to losses of more
                 than 2 years across areas. Fourth, geographic differences in
                 life expectancy for individuals in the lowest income quartile
                 were significantly correlated with health behaviors such as
                 smoking (r = -0.69, P < .001), but were not significantly
                 correlated with access to medical care, physical environmental
                 factors, income inequality, or labor market conditions. Life
                 expectancy for low-income individuals was positively
                 correlated with the local area fraction of immigrants (r =
                 0.72, P < .001), fraction of college graduates (r = 0.42, P <
                 .001), and government expenditures (r = 0.57, P < .001).
                 Conclusions and Relevance: In the United States between 2001
                 and 2014, higher income was associated with greater longevity,
                 and differences in life expectancy across income groups
                 increased over time. However, the association between life
                 expectancy and income varied substantially across areas;
                 differences in longevity across income groups decreased in
                 some areas and increased in others. The differences in life
                 expectancy were correlated with health behaviors and local
                 area characteristics.",

  abstract      = "The recently renewed interest in a possible additional major
                   body in the outer solar system prompted us to study the
                   thermodynamic evolution of such an object. We assumed that
                   it is a smaller version of Uranus and Neptune. We modeled
                   the temporal evolution of the radius, temperature, intrinsic
                   luminosity, and the blackbody spectrum of distant ice giant
                   planets. The aim is also to provide estimates of the
                   magnitudes in different bands to assess whether the object
                   might be detectable. Simulations of the cooling and
                   contraction were conducted for ice giants with masses of 5,
                   10, 20, and 50 Mearth that are located at 280, 700, and 1120
                   AU from the Sun. The core composition, the fraction of H/He,
                   the efficiency of energy transport, and the initial
                   luminosity were varied. The atmospheric opacity was set to
                   1, 50, and 100 times solar metallicity. We find for a
                   nominal 10 Mearth planet at 700 AU at the current age of the
                   solar system an effective temperature of 47 K, much higher
                   than the equilibrium temperature of about 10 K, a radius of
                   3.7 Rearth, and an intrinsic luminosity of 0.006 Ljupiter.
                   It has estimated apparent magnitudes of Johnson V, R, I, L,
                   N, Q of 21.7, 21.4, 21.0, 20.1, 19.9, and 10.7, and WISE
                   W1-W4 magnitudes of 20.1, 20.1, 18.6, and 10.2. The Q and W4
                   band and other observations longward of about 13 microns
                   pick up the intrinsic flux. If candidate Planet 9 has a
                   significant H/He layer and an efficient energy transport in
                   the interior, then its luminosity is dominated by the
                   intrinsic contribution, making it a self-luminous planet. At
                   a likely position on its orbit near aphelion, we estimate
                   for a mass of 5, 10, 20, and 50 Mearth a V magnitude from
                   the reflected light of 24.3, 23.7, 23.3, and 22.6 and a Q
                   magnitude from the intrinsic radiation of 14.6, 11.7, 9.2,

  abstract = "Originally developed to explain cultural variation in moral
              judgments, moral foundations theory (MFT) has become widely
              adopted as a theory of political ideology. MFT posits that
              political attitudes are rooted in instinctual evaluations
              generated by innate psychological modules evolved to solve social
              dilemmas. If this is correct, moral foundations must be
              relatively stable dispositional traits, changes in moral
              foundations should systematically predict consequent changes in
              political orientations, and, at least in part, moral foundations
              must be heritable. We test these hypotheses and find substantial
              variability in individual-level moral foundations across time,
              and little evidence that these changes account for changes in
              political attitudes. We also find little evidence that moral
              foundations are heritable. These findings raise questions about
              the future of MFT as a theory of ideology. Replication Materials:

              approach to arriving at metrics for assessing technological
              progress. The approach is applied to three functional categories

              transformation by first building a 100 plus year database for
              each of the three functional categories. The results indicate
              generally continuous progress for each functional category
              independent of the specific underlying technological artifacts

  abstract    = "OBJECTIVE: Although individual differences in the application
                 of moral principles, such as utilitarianism, have been
                 documented, so too have powerful context effects - effects
                 that raise doubts about the durability of people's moral
                 principles. In this paper, we examine the robustness of
                 individual differences in moral judgment by examining them
                 across time and across different decision contexts. METHOD: In
                 Study 1, consistency in utilitarian judgment of 122 adult
                 participants was examined over two different survey sessions.
                 In Studies 2A and 2B, large samples (Ns = 130 and 327,
                 respectively) of adult participants made a series of 32 moral
                 judgments across eight different contexts that are known to
                 affect preferences for utilitarian outcomes. RESULTS: Contrary
                 to some contemporary theorizing, our results reveal a strong
                 degree of consistency in moral judgment. Across time and
                 experimental manipulations of context, individuals maintained
                 their relative standing on utilitarianism, and aggregated
                 moral decisions reached levels of near-perfect consistency.
                 CONCLUSION: Results support the view that on at least one
                 dimension (utilitarianism), people's moral judgments are
                 robustly consistent, with context effects tailoring the
                 application of principles to the particulars of any given
                 moral judgment. This article is protected by copyright. All

                   components for rare words. Our character-level recurrent
                   neural networks compute source word representations and
                   recover unknown target words when needed. The two-fold
                   advantage of such a hybrid approach is that it is much
                   faster and easier to train than character-based ones; at the
                   same time, it never produces unknown words as in the case of
                   word-based models. On the WMT'15 English to Czech
                   translation task, this hybrid approach offers a boost of up
                   to +7.9 BLEU points over models that do not handle unknown
                   words. Our best hybrid system has established a new
                   state-of-the-art result with 19.9 BLEU score. We demonstrate
                   that our character models can successfully learn to not only
                   generate well-formed words for Czech, a highly-inflected
                   language with a very complex vocabulary, but also build
                   correct representations for English source words.",

                   interest in building systems that learn and think like
                   people. Many advances have come from using deep neural
                   networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as object
                   recognition, video games, and board games, achieving
                   performance that equals or even beats humans in some
                   respects. Despite their biological inspiration and
                   performance achievements, these systems differ from human
                   intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in
                   cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning
                   and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current
                   engineering trends in both what they learn, and how they
                   learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should
                   (a) build causal models of the world that support
                   explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving
                   pattern recognition problems; (b) ground learning in
                   intuitive theories of physics and psychology, to support and
                   enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (c) harness
                   compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire
                   and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations. We

               considerable obstacle when attention must be maintained over
               time. Mental training through meditation has been proposed as an
               effective method of attenuating the ebb and flow of attention to
               thoughts and feelings that distract from one’s foremost present

               intensive meditation training in focused attention and
               monitoring meditation is associated with attenuated lapses of
               attention while reading. Across 2 studies, participants
               completed a reading task requiring ongoing error monitoring to
               detect episodes of semantic inconsistency. In a preliminary

  author   = "Kipping, David M and Teachey, Alex",
  abstract = "The transit method is presently the most successful planet
              discovery and characterization tool at our disposal. Other
              advanced civilizations would surely be aware of this technique
              and appreciate that their home planet’s existence and
              habitability is essentially broadcast to all stars lying along
              their ecliptic plane. We suggest that advanced civilizations
              could cloak their presence, or deliberately broadcast it, through
              controlled laser emission. Such emission could distort the
              apparent shape of their transit light curves with relatively
              little energy, due to the collimated beam and relatively
              infrequent nature of transits. We estimate that humanity could
              cloak the Earth from Kepler-like broadband surveys using an
              optical monochromatic laser array emitting a peak power of ∼30 MW
              for ∼10 hours per year. A chromatic cloak, effective at all
              wavelengths, is more challenging requiring a large array of
              tunable lasers with a total power of ∼250 MW. Alternatively, a
              civilization could cloak only the atmospheric signatures
              associated with biological activity on their world, such as
              oxygen, which is achievable with a peak laser power of just ∼160
              kW per transit. Finally, we suggest that the time of transit for
              optical SETI is analogous to the water-hole in radio SETI,
              providing a clear window in which observers may expect to
              communicate. Accordingly, we propose that a civilization may
              deliberately broadcast their technological capabilities by
              distorting their transit to an artificial shape, which serves as
              both a SETI beacon and a medium for data transmission. Such
              signatures could be readily searched in the archival data of
              transit surveys.",

              short-termism and the allocation of authority, both of which are

  abstract      = "Advances in deep learning have led to the broad adoption of
                   Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to a range of important machine
                   learning problems, e.g., guiding autonomous vehicles, speech
                   recognition, malware detection. Yet, machine learning
                   models, including DNNs, were shown to be vulnerable to
                   adversarial samples-subtly (and often humanly
                   indistinguishably) modified malicious inputs crafted to
                   compromise the integrity of their outputs. Adversarial
                   examples thus enable adversaries to manipulate system
                   behaviors. Potential attacks include attempts to control the
                   behavior of vehicles, have spam content identified as
                   legitimate content, or have malware identified as legitimate
                   software. Adversarial examples are known to transfer from
                   one model to another, even if the second model has a
                   different architecture or was trained on a different set. We
                   introduce the first practical demonstration that this
                   cross-model transfer phenomenon enables attackers to control
                   a remotely hosted DNN with no access to the model, its
                   parameters, or its training data. In our demonstration, we
                   only assume that the adversary can observe outputs from the
                   target DNN given inputs chosen by the adversary. We
                   introduce the attack strategy of fitting a substitute model
                   to the input-output pairs in this manner, then crafting
                   adversarial examples based on this auxiliary model. We
                   evaluate the approach on existing DNN datasets and
                   real-world settings. In one experiment, we force a DNN
                   supported by MetaMind (one of the online APIs for DNN
                   classifiers) to mis-classify inputs at a rate of 84.24\%. We
                   conclude with experiments exploring why adversarial samples
                   transfer between DNNs, and a discussion on the applicability
                   of our attack when targeting machine learning algorithms
                   distinct from DNNs.",

              Nonetheless, people typically overestimate their prowess---but is
              this true of everyone? Three studies examined who shows
              overconfidence and why. Study 1 demonstrated that participants
              with an entity (fixed) theory of intelligence, those known to
              avoid negative information, showed significantly more
              overconfidence than those with more incremental (malleable)
              theories. In Study 2, participants who were taught an entity
              theory of intelligence allocated less attention to difficult
              problems than those taught an incremental theory. Participants in
              this entity condition also displayed more overconfidence than
              those in the incremental condition, and this difference in
              overconfidence was mediated by the observed bias in attention to
              difficult problems. Finally, in Study 3, directing participants'
              attention to difficult aspects of the task reduced the
              overconfidence of those with more entity views of intelligence.
              Implications for reducing biased self-assessments that can

                   of late-K and M-dwarf stars are expected to be in
                   synchronous rotation, as a consequence of strong tidal
                   interactions with their host stars. Previous global climate
                   model (GCM) studies have shown that, for slowly-rotating
                   planets, strong convection at the substellar point can
                   create optically thick water clouds, increasing the
                   planetary albedo, and thus stabilizing the climate against a
                   thermal runaway. However these studies did not use
                   self-consistent orbital/rotational periods for synchronously
                   rotating planets placed at different distances from the host
                   star. Here we provide new estimates of the inner edge of the
                   habitable zone for synchronously rotating terrestrial
                   planets around late-K and M-dwarf stars using a 3-D
                   Earth-analog GCM with self-consistent relationships between
                   stellar metallicity, stellar effective temperature, and the
                   planetary orbital/rotational period. We find that both
                   atmospheric dynamics and the efficacy of the substellar
                   cloud deck are sensitive to the precise rotation rate of the
                   planet. Around mid-to-late M-dwarf stars with low
                   metallicity, planetary rotation rates at the inner edge of
                   the HZ become faster, and the inner edge of the habitable
                   zone is farther away from the host stars than in previous
                   GCM studies. For an Earth-sized planet, the dynamical regime
                   of the substellar clouds begins to transition as the
                   rotation rate approaches ~10 days. These faster rotation
                   rates produce stronger zonal winds that encircle the planet
                   and smear the substellar clouds around it, lowering the
                   planetary albedo, and causing the onset of the water-vapor
                   greenhouse climatic instability to occur at up to ~25\%
                   lower incident stellar fluxes than found in previous GCM
                   studies. For mid-to-late M-dwarf stars with high metallicity

                   lookback-time effects, the average terrestrial planet on our
                   past light cone has an age of just $1.7\textbackslash{}pm
                   0.2$ Gyr and is sitting in a galaxy with a stellar mass a
                   factor of $\textbackslash{}approx 2$ lower than that of the

  abstract    = "It has been theorized that inducing extreme reproductive sex
                 ratios could be a method to suppress or eliminate pest
                 populations. Limited knowledge about the genetic makeup and
                 mode of action of naturally occurring sex distorters and the
                 prevalence of co-evolving suppressors has hampered their use
                 for control. Here we generate a synthetic sex distortion
                 system by exploiting the specificity of the homing
                 endonuclease I-PpoI, which is able to selectively cleave
                 ribosomal gene sequences of the malaria vector Anopheles
                 gambiae that are located exclusively on the mosquito's X
                 chromosome. We combine structure-based protein engineering and
                 molecular genetics to restrict the activity of the potentially
                 toxic endonuclease to spermatogenesis. Shredding of the
                 paternal X chromosome prevents it from being transmitted to
                 the next generation, resulting in fully fertile mosquito
                 strains that produce >95\% male offspring. We demonstrate that
                 distorter male mosquitoes can efficiently suppress caged
                 wild-type mosquito populations, providing the foundation for a
                 new class of genetic vector control strategies.",

  abstract    = "The hard problem of consciousness has been often claimed to be
                 unsolvable by the methods of traditional empirical sciences.
                 It has been argued that all the objects of empirical sciences
                 can be fully analyzed in structural terms but that
                 consciousness is (or has) something over and above its
                 structure. However, modern neuroscience has introduced a
                 theoretical framework in which also the apparently
                 non-structural aspects of consciousness, namely the so called
                 qualia or qualitative properties, can be analyzed in
                 structural terms. That framework allows us to see qualia as
                 something compositional with internal structures that fully
                 determine their qualitative nature. Moreover, those internal
                 structures can be identified which certain neural patterns.
                 Thus consciousness as a whole can be seen as a complex neural
                 pattern that misperceives some of its own highly complex
                 structural properties as monadic and qualitative. Such neural
                 pattern is analyzable in fully structural terms and thereby
                 the hard problem is solved.",

  abstract    = "KEY POINTS: Aerobic exercise such as running enhances adult
                 hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) in rodents. Little is known
                 about the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIT) or
                 of purely anaerobic resistance training on AHN. Here, compared
                 to a sedentary lifestyle, we report a very modest effect of
                 HIT and no effect of resistance training on AHN in adult male
                 rats. We find most AHN in rats that were selectively bred for
                 an innately high response to aerobic exercise that also run
                 voluntarily and - increase maximum running capacity. Our
                 results confirm that sustained aerobic exercise is key in
                 improving AHN. ABSTRACT: Aerobic exercise, such as running,
                 has positive effects on brain structure and function, for
                 example, adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) and learning.
                 Whether high-intensity interval training (HIT), referring to
                 alternating short bouts of very intense anaerobic exercise
                 with recovery periods, or anaerobic resistance training (RT)
                 has similar effects on AHN is unclear. In addition, individual
                 genetic variation in the overall response to physical exercise
                 likely plays a part in the effects of exercise on AHN but is
                 less studied. Recently, we developed polygenic rat models that
                 gain differentially for running capacity in response to
                 aerobic treadmill training. Here we subjected these Low
                 Response Trainer (LRT) and High Response Trainer (HRT) adult
                 male rats to various forms of physical exercise for 6 to 8
                 weeks and examined its effects on AHN. Compared to sedentary
                 animals, the highest number of doublecortin-positive
                 hippocampal cells was observed in HRT rats that ran
                 voluntarily on a running wheel while HIT on the treadmill had
                 a smaller, statistically non-significant effect on AHN. AHN
                 was elevated in both LRT and HRT rats that endurance trained
                 on a treadmill compared to those that performed RT by climbing
                 a vertical ladder with weights, despite their significant gain
                 in strength. Furthermore, RT had no effect on proliferation
                 (Ki67), maturation (doublecortin) or survival (BrdU) of new
                 adult-born hippocampal neurons in adult male Sprague-Dawley
                 rats. Our results suggest physical exercise promotes AHN most
                 if it is aerobic and sustained, and especially when
                 accompanied by a heightened genetic predisposition for
                 response to physical exercise. This article is protected by

                   meaning in children's books. Unlike standard language
                   modelling benchmarks, it distinguishes the task of
                   predicting syntactic function words from that of predicting
                   lower-frequency words, which carry greater semantic content.
                   We compare a range of state-of-the-art models, each with a
                   different way of encoding what has been previously read. We
                   show that models which store explicit representations of
                   long-term contexts outperform state-of-the-art neural
                   language models at predicting semantic content words,
                   although this advantage is not observed for syntactic
                   function words. Interestingly, we find that the amount of
                   text encoded in a single memory representation is highly
                   influential to the performance: there is a sweet-spot, not
                   too big and not too small, between single words and full
                   sentences that allows the most meaningful information in a
                   text to be effectively retained and recalled. Further, the
                   attention over such window-based memories can be trained
                   effectively through self-supervision. We then assess the
                   generality of this principle by applying it to the CNN QA
                   benchmark, which involves identifying named entities in

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: The quality and quantity of individuals' social
                 relationships has been linked not only to mental health but
                 also to both morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVES: This
                 meta-analytic review was conducted to determine the extent to
                 which social relationships influence risk for mortality, which
                 aspects of social relationships are most highly predictive,
                 and which factors may moderate the risk. DATA EXTRACTION: Data
                 were extracted on several participant characteristics,
                 including cause of mortality, initial health status, and
                 pre-existing health conditions, as well as on study
                 characteristics, including length of follow-up and type of
                 assessment of social relationships. RESULTS: Across 148
                 studies (308,849 participants), the random effects weighted
                 average effect size was OR = 1.50 (95\% CI 1.42 to 1.59),
                 indicating a 50\% increased likelihood of survival for
                 participants with stronger social relationships. This finding
                 remained consistent across age, sex, initial health status,
                 cause of death, and follow-up period. Significant differences
                 were found across the type of social measurement evaluated
                 (p<0.001); the association was strongest for complex measures
                 of social integration (OR = 1.91; 95\% CI 1.63 to 2.23) and
                 lowest for binary indicators of residential status (living
                 alone versus with others) (OR = 1.19; 95\% CI 0.99 to 1.44).
                 CONCLUSIONS: The influence of social relationships on risk for
                 mortality is comparable with well-established risk factors for
                 mortality. Please see later in the article for the Editors'

               underlies the feasibility of effecting a net change in both the
               speed and direction of motion of a spacecraft by passage through
               the gravitational field of a planet or a planetary satellite.
               The resulting increase, or decrease, in the kinetic energy of
               the spacecraft appears to contradict the casual expectation that
               in such an encounter the kinetic energy of the spacecraft after
               the encounter would be the same as that before the encounter.
               This paper describes the December 1973 encounter of the Pioneer
               10 spacecraft with the planet Jupiter as a real-life example of
               gravitational assist. It then discusses the physical principles

               suffers from poor sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility.
               The goal of this work, called the Autoscope, is a low-cost
               automated digital microscope coupled with a set of computer
               vision and classification algorithms, which can accurately
               diagnose of a variety of infectious diseases, targeting
               use-cases in the developing world. Our initial target is
               malaria, because of the high difficulty of the task and because
               manual microscopy is currently a central but highly imperfect
               tool for malaria work in the field. In addition to diagnosis,
               the algorithm performs species identification and quantitation

                 cryopreservation science for the neurobiological research
                 community. ASC is a new brain-banking technique designed to
                 facilitate neuroanatomic research such as connectomics
                 research, and has the unique ability to combine stable long
                 term ice-free sample storage with excellent anatomical
                 resolution. To demonstrate the feasibility of ASC, we
                 perfuse-fixed rabbit and pig brains with a
                 glutaraldehyde-based fixative, then slowly perfused increasing
                 concentrations of ethylene glycol over several hours in a
                 manner similar to techniques used for whole organ
                 cryopreservation. Once 65\% w/v ethylene glycol was reached,
                 we vitrified brains at -135 °C for indefinite long-term
                 storage. Vitrified brains were rewarmed and the cryoprotectant
                 removed either by perfusion or gradual diffusion from brain
                 slices. We evaluated ASC-processed brains by electron
                 microscopy of multiple regions across the whole brain and by
                 Focused Ion Beam Milling and Scanning Electron Microscopy
                 (FIB-SEM) imaging of selected brain volumes. Preservation was
                 uniformly excellent: processes were easily traceable and

                 cryopreservation has many advantages over other brain-banking
                 techniques: chemicals are delivered via perfusion, which
                 enables easy scaling to brains of any size; vitrification
                 ensures that the ultrastructure of the brain will not degrade
                 even over very long storage times; and the cryoprotectant can
                 be removed, yielding a perfusable aldehyde-preserved brain
                 which is suitable for a wide variety of brain assays.",

  abstract = "Abstract Hundreds of studies have shown that, in people,
              cognitive abilities overlap yielding an underlying ‘g’ factor,
              which explains much of the variance. We assessed individual
              differences in cognitive abilities in 68 border collies to
              determine the structure of intelligence in dogs. We administered
              four configurations of a detour test and repeated trials of two
              choice tasks (point-following and quantity-discrimination). We
              used confirmatory factor analysis to test alternative models
              explaining test performance. The best-fitting model was a
              hierarchical model with three lower-order factors for the detour
              time, choice time, and choice score and a higher order factor;
              these accounted jointly for 68\% of the variance in task scores.
              The higher order factor alone accounted for 17\% of the variance.
              Dogs that quickly completed the detour tasks also tended to score
              highly on the choice tasks; this could be explained by a general
              intelligence factor. Learning about g in non human species is an
              essential component of developing a complete theory of g; this is
              feasible because testing cognitive abilities in other species
              does not depend on ecologically relevant tests. Discovering the
              place of g among fitness-bearing traits in other species will
              constitute a major advance in understanding the evolution of

                 alternative Gaian bottleneck explanation: If life emerges on a
                 planet, it only rarely evolves quickly enough to regulate
                 greenhouse gases and albedo, thereby maintaining surface
                 temperatures compatible with liquid water and habitability.
                 Such a Gaian bottleneck suggests that (i) extinction is the
                 cosmic default for most life that has ever emerged on the
                 surfaces of wet rocky planets in the Universe and (ii) rocky
                 planets need to be inhabited to remain habitable. In the Gaian
                 bottleneck model, the maintenance of planetary habitability is
                 a property more associated with an unusually rapid evolution
                 of biological regulation of surface volatiles than with the
                 luminosity and distance to the host star. KEY WORDS:

  abstract    = "Conspiratorial ideation is the tendency of individuals to
                 believe that events and power relations are secretly
                 manipulated by certain clandestine groups and organisations.
                 Many of these ostensibly explanatory conjectures are
                 non-falsifiable, lacking in evidence or demonstrably false,
                 yet public acceptance remains high. Efforts to convince the
                 general public of the validity of medical and scientific
                 findings can be hampered by such narratives, which can create
                 the impression of doubt or disagreement in areas where the
                 science is well established. Conversely, historical examples
                 of exposed conspiracies do exist and it may be difficult for
                 people to differentiate between reasonable and dubious
                 assertions. In this work, we establish a simple mathematical
                 model for conspiracies involving multiple actors with time,
                 which yields failure probability for any given conspiracy.
                 Parameters for the model are estimated from literature
                 examples of known scandals, and the factors influencing
                 conspiracy success and failure are explored. The model is also
                 used to estimate the likelihood of claims from some
                 commonly-held conspiratorial beliefs; these are namely that
                 the moon-landings were faked, climate-change is a hoax,
                 vaccination is dangerous and that a cure for cancer is being
                 suppressed by vested interests. Simulations of these claims
                 predict that intrinsic failure would be imminent even with the
                 most generous estimates for the secret-keeping ability of
                 active participants-the results of this model suggest that
                 large conspiracies (≥1000 agents) quickly become untenable and
                 prone to failure. The theory presented here might be useful in
                 counteracting the potentially deleterious consequences of
                 bogus and anti-science narratives, and examining the
                 hypothetical conditions under which sustainable conspiracy
                 might be possible.",

                 social media facilitates the aggregation of people around
                 common interests, worldviews, and narratives. However, the
                 World Wide Web (WWW) also allows for the rapid dissemination
                 of unsubstantiated rumors and conspiracy theories that often
                 elicit rapid, large, but naive social responses such as the
                 recent case of Jade Helm 15--where a simple military exercise
                 turned out to be perceived as the beginning of a new civil war
                 in the United States. In this work, we address the
                 determinants governing misinformation spreading through a
                 thorough quantitative analysis. In particular, we focus on how
                 Facebook users consume information related to two distinct
                 narratives: scientific and conspiracy news. We find that,
                 although consumers of scientific and conspiracy stories
                 present similar consumption patterns with respect to content,
                 cascade dynamics differ. Selective exposure to content is the
                 primary driver of content diffusion and generates the
                 formation of homogeneous clusters, i.e., ``echo chambers.''
                 Indeed, homogeneity appears to be the primary driver for the
                 diffusion of contents and each echo chamber has its own
                 cascade dynamics. Finally, we introduce a data-driven
                 percolation model mimicking rumor spreading and we show that
                 homogeneity and polarization are the main determinants for
                 predicting cascades' size.",

              democracy built on Google's internal corporate Google+ social
              network. Liquid democracy decision-making systems can scale to
              cover large groups by enabling voters to delegate their votes to
              other voters. This approach is in contrast to direct democracy
              systems where voters vote directly on issues, and representative
              democracy systems where voters elect representatives to vote on
              issues for them. Liquid democracy systems can provide many of the
              benefits of both direct and representative democracy systems with
              few of the weaknesses. Thus far, high implementation complexity
              and infrastructure costs have prevented widespread adoption.
              Google Votes demonstrates how the use of social-networking
              technology can overcome these barriers and enable practical
              liquid democracy systems. The case-study of Google Votes usage at
              Google over a 3 year timeframe is included, as well as a
              framework for evaluating vote visibility called the ``Golden Rule

                   spacecraft shows episodes of unique and inexplicable
                   day-long dips with up to 20\% dimming. Here, I provide a
                   light curve of 1232 Johnson B-band magnitudes from 1890 to
                   1989 taken from archival photographic plates at Harvard. KIC
                   8462852 displays a highly significant and highly confident
                   secular dimming at an average rate of 0.165+-0.013
                   magnitudes per century. From the early 1890s to the late
                   1980s, KIC 8462852 has faded by 0.193+-0.030 mag. This
                   century-long dimming is completely unprecedented for any
                   F-type main sequence star. So the Harvard light curve
                   provides the first confirmation (past the several dips seen
                   in the Kepler light curve alone) that KIC 8462852 has
                   anything unusual going on. The century-long dimming and the
                   day-long dips are both just extreme ends of a spectrum of
                   timescales for unique dimming events, so by Ockham's Razor,
                   all this is produced by one physical mechanism. This one
                   mechanism does not appear as any isolated catastrophic event
                   in the last century, but rather must be some ongoing process
                   with continuous effects. Within the context of
                   dust-occultation models, the century-long dimming trend
                   requires 10^4 to 10^7 times as much dust as for the one
                   deepest Kepler dip. Within the context of the comet-family
                   idea, the century-long dimming trend requires an estimated
                   648,000 giant comets (each with 200 km diameter) all
                   orchestrated to pass in front of the star within the last

                 may be associated with reduced mortality, but the relationship
                 is not well established. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the
                 association between vegetarian dietary patterns and mortality.
                 DESIGN: Prospective cohort study; mortality analysis by Cox
                 proportional hazards regression, controlling for important
                 demographic and lifestyle confounders. SETTING: Adventist
                 Health Study 2 (AHS-2), a large North American cohort.
                 PARTICIPANTS: A total of 96,469 Seventh-day Adventist men and
                 women recruited between 2002 and 2007, from which an analytic
                 sample of 73,308 participants remained after exclusions.
                 EXPOSURES: Diet was assessed at baseline by a quantitative
                 food frequency questionnaire and categorized into 5 dietary
                 patterns: nonvegetarian, semi-vegetarian, pesco-vegetarian,
                 lacto-ovo-vegetarian, and vegan. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: The
                 relationship between vegetarian dietary patterns and all-cause
                 and cause-specific mortality; deaths through 2009 were
                 identified from the National Death Index. RESULTS: There were
                 2570 deaths among 73,308 participants during a mean follow-up
                 time of 5.79 years. The mortality rate was 6.05 (95\% CI,
                 5.82-6.29) deaths per 1000 person-years. The adjusted hazard
                 ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality in all vegetarians combined
                 vs nonvegetarians was 0.88 (95\% CI, 0.80-0.97). The adjusted
                 HR for all-cause mortality in vegans was 0.85 (95\% CI,
                 0.73-1.01); in lacto-ovo-vegetarians, 0.91 (95\% CI,
                 0.82-1.00); in pesco-vegetarians, 0.81 (95\% CI, 0.69-0.94);
                 and in semi-vegetarians, 0.92 (95\% CI, 0.75-1.13) compared
                 with nonvegetarians. Significant associations with vegetarian
                 diets were detected for cardiovascular mortality,
                 noncardiovascular noncancer mortality, renal mortality, and
                 endocrine mortality. Associations in men were larger and more
                 often significant than were those in women. CONCLUSIONS AND
                 RELEVANCE: Vegetarian diets are associated with lower
                 all-cause mortality and with some reductions in cause-specific
                 mortality. Results appeared to be more robust in males. These
                 favorable associations should be considered carefully by those
                 offering dietary guidance.",

  abstract    = "Data transport across short electrical wires is limited by
                 both bandwidth and power density, which creates a performance
                 bottleneck for semiconductor microchips in modern computer
                 systems--from mobile phones to large-scale data centres. These
                 limitations can be overcome by using optical communications
                 based on chip-scale electronic-photonic systems enabled by
                 silicon-based nanophotonic devices. However, combining
                 electronics and photonics on the same chip has proved
                 challenging, owing to microchip manufacturing conflicts
                 between electronics and photonics. Consequently, current
                 electronic-photonic chips are limited to niche manufacturing
                 processes and include only a few optical devices alongside
                 simple circuits. Here we report an electronic-photonic system
                 on a single chip integrating over 70 million transistors and
                 850 photonic components that work together to provide logic,
                 memory, and interconnect functions. This system is a
                 realization of a microprocessor that uses on-chip photonic
                 devices to directly communicate with other chips using light.
                 To integrate electronics and photonics at the scale of a
                 microprocessor chip, we adopt a 'zero-change' approach to the
                 integration of photonics. Instead of developing a custom
                 process to enable the fabrication of photonics, which would
                 complicate or eliminate the possibility of integration with
                 state-of-the-art transistors at large scale and at high yield,
                 we design optical devices using a standard microelectronics
                 foundry process that is used for modern microprocessors. This
                 demonstration could represent the beginning of an era of
                 chip-scale electronic-photonic systems with the potential to
                 transform computing system architectures, enabling more

                   ranging from intelligence explosion to technological
                   unemployment have made diverse claims about the nature,
                   pace, and drivers of progress in AI. However, these theories
                   are rarely specified in enough detail to enable systematic
                   evaluation of their assumptions or to extrapolate progress

                   the last 2000 years, finding techniques for dealing with
                   incompleteness and unreliability of historical data. We
                   introduce a novel approach to apply extreme value theory to
                   fat-tailed variables that have a remote, but nonetheless
                   finite upper bound, by defining a corresponding unbounded
                   dual distribution (given that potential war casualties are
                   bounded by the world population). We apply methods from
                   extreme value theory on the dual distribution and derive its
                   tail properties. The dual method allows us to calculate the
                   real mean of war casualties, which proves to be considerably
                   larger than the sample mean, meaning severe underestimation
                   of the tail risks of conflicts from naive observation. We
                   analyze the robustness of our results to errors in
                   historical reports, taking into account the unreliability of
                   accounts by historians and absence of critical data. We
                   study inter-arrival times between tail events and find that
                   no particular trend can be asserted. All the statistical
                   pictures obtained are at variance with the prevailing claims

  abstract = "Population turnover is necessary for progressive evolution. In
              the context of a niche with fixed carrying capacity, aging
              contributes to the rate of population turnover. Theoretically, a
              population in which death is programmed on a fixed schedule can
              evolve more rapidly than one in which population turnover is left
              to a random death rate. Could aging evolve on this basis?
              Quantitative realization of this idea is problematic, since the
              short-term individual fitness cost is likely to eliminate any
              hypothetical gene for programmed death before the long-term
              benefit can be realized. In 2011, one of us proposed the first
              quantitative model based on this mechanism that robustly evolves
              a finite, programmed life span. That model was based on a viscous
              population in a rapidly changing environment. Here, we strip this
              model to its essence and eliminate the assumption of
              environmental change. We conclude that there is no obvious way in
              which this model is unrealistic, and that it may indeed capture
              an important principle of nature’s workings. We suggest aging may
              be understood within the context of the emerging science of
              evolvability.",

  abstract = "While cautioned by Ted Peters’ critique of the more radical brand

              openness on the part of Christian theology toward the
              transhumanist/posthumanist program. A key concern will be the
              place of the human body. Christians affirm an eschatological
              resurrection of the body. This stands in contrast to radical
              transhumanists who seek cybernetic immortality---that is,
              disembodied intelligence. Yet, such intelligence could manifest
              in a virtual or robotic body. Therefore, it turns out that a
              posthuman entity, whether an upload or superintelligence, can
              have a body, albeit qualitatively different from the familiar
              flesh and blood body. If a pothuman entity can also have

  abstract      = "Conversational modeling is an important task in natural
                   language understanding and machine intelligence. Although
                   previous approaches exist, they are often restricted to
                   specific domains (e.g., booking an airline ticket) and
                   require hand-crafted rules. In this paper, we present a
                   simple approach for this task which uses the recently
                   proposed sequence to sequence framework. Our model converses
                   by predicting the next sentence given the previous sentence
                   or sentences in a conversation. The strength of our model is
                   that it can be trained end-to-end and thus requires much
                   fewer hand-crafted rules. We find that this straightforward
                   model can generate simple conversations given a large
                   conversational training dataset. Our preliminary results
                   suggest that, despite optimizing the wrong objective
                   function, the model is able to converse well. It is able
                   extract knowledge from both a domain specific dataset, and
                   from a large, noisy, and general domain dataset of movie
                   subtitles. On a domain-specific IT helpdesk dataset, the
                   model can find a solution to a technical problem via
                   conversations. On a noisy open-domain movie transcript
                   dataset, the model can perform simple forms of common sense
                   reasoning. As expected, we also find that the lack of
                   consistency is a common failure mode of our model.",

                 using CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) to guide the silencing of invading

                 increased risk of cardiovascular events and death associated
                 with sulphonylureas versus metformin. However, it has never
                 been determined whether this was due to the beneficial effects
                 of metformin or detrimental effects of sulphonylureas. The
                 objective of this study was therefore to compare all-cause
                 mortality in diabetic patients treated first-line with either
                 sulphonylurea or metformin monotherapy with that in matched
                 individuals without diabetes. METHODS: We used retrospective
                 observational data from the UK Clinical Practice Research
                 Datalink (CPRD) from 2000. Subjects with type 2 diabetes who
                 progressed to first-line treatment with metformin or
                 sulphonylurea monotherapy were selected and matched to people
                 without diabetes. Progression to all-cause mortality was
                 compared using parametric survival models that included a
                 range of relevant co-variables. RESULTS: We identified 78,241
                 subjects treated with metformin, 12,222 treated with
                 sulphonylurea, and 90,463 matched subjects without diabetes.
                 This resulted in a total, censored follow-up period of 503,384
                 years. There were 7498 deaths in total, representing
                 unadjusted mortality rates of 14.4 and 15.2, and 50.9 and 28.7
                 deaths per 1000 person-years for metformin monotherapy and
                 their matched controls, and sulphonylurea monotherapy and
                 their matched controls, respectively. With reference to
                 observed survival in diabetic patients initiated with
                 metformin monotherapy [survival time ratio (STR) = 1.0],
                 adjusted median survival time was 15\% lower (STR = 0.85, 95\%
                 CI 0.81-0.90) in matched individuals without diabetes and 38\%
                 lower (0.62, 0.58-0.66) in diabetic patients treated with
                 sulphonylurea monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with type 2
                 diabetes initiated with metformin monotherapy had longer
                 survival than did matched, non-diabetic controls. Those
                 treated with sulphonylurea had markedly reduced survival
                 compared with both matched controls and those receiving
                 metformin monotherapy. This supports the position of metformin
                 as first-line therapy and implies that metformin may confer
                 benefit in non-diabetes. Sulphonylurea remains a concern.",

                 diabetes, has been noted to extend healthspan of nondiabetic
                 mice, but this outcome, and the molecular mechanisms that
                 underlie it, have received relatively little experimental
                 attention. To develop a genetic model for study of biguanide
                 effects on healthspan, we investigated metformin impact on
                 aging Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that metformin
                 increases nematode healthspan, slowing lipofuscin
                 accumulation, extending median lifespan, and prolonging
                 youthful locomotory ability in a dose-dependent manner.
                 Genetic data suggest that metformin acts through a mechanism
                 similar to that operative in eating-impaired dietary
                 restriction (DR) mutants, but independent of the insulin
                 signaling pathway. Energy sensor AMPK and AMPK-activating
                 kinase LKB1, which are activated in mammals by metformin
                 treatment, are essential for health benefits in C. elegans,
                 suggesting that metformin engages a metabolic loop conserved
                 across phyla. We also show that the conserved oxidative
                 stress-responsive transcription factor SKN-1/Nrf2 is essential
                 for metformin healthspan benefits in C. elegans, a mechanistic
                 requirement not previously described in mammals. skn-1, which
                 functions in nematode sensory neurons to promote DR longevity
                 benefits and in intestines for oxidative stress resistance
                 lifespan benefits, must be expressed in both neurons and
                 intestines for metformin-promoted healthspan extension,
                 supporting that metformin improves healthy middle-life aging
                 by activating both DR and antioxidant defense longevity
                 pathways. In addition to defining molecular players operative
                 in metformin healthspan benefits, our data suggest that

                 demography and sociology of Ashkenazim in medieval Europe
                 selected for intelligence. Ashkenazi literacy, economic
                 specialization, and closure to inward gene flow led to a
                 social environment in which there was high fitness payoff to
                 intelligence, specifically verbal and mathematical
                 intelligence but not spatial ability. As with any regime of
                 strong directional selection on a quantitative trait, genetic
                 variants that were otherwise fitness reducing rose in
                 frequency. In particular we propose that the well-known
                 clusters of Ashkenazi genetic diseases, the sphingolipid
                 cluster and the DNA repair cluster in particular, increase
                 intelligence in heterozygotes. Other Ashkenazi disorders are
                 known to increase intelligence. Although these disorders have
                 been attributed to a bottleneck in Ashkenazi history and
                 consequent genetic drift, there is no evidence of any
                 bottleneck. Gene frequencies at a large number of autosomal
                 loci show that if there was a bottleneck then subsequent gene
                 flow from Europeans must have been very large, obliterating
                 the effects of any bottleneck. The clustering of the disorders
                 in only a few pathways and the presence at elevated frequency
                 of more than one deleterious allele at many of them could not
                 have been produced by drift. Instead these are signatures of
                 strong and recent natural selection.",

                 Can the entire distribution of human intelligence be accounted
                 for by just one general factor? Is intelligence supported by a
                 single neural system? Here, we provide a perspective on human
                 intelligence that takes into account how general abilities or
                 ``factors'' reflect the functional organization of the brain.
                 By comparing factor models of individual differences in
                 performance with factor models of brain functional
                 organization, we demonstrate that different components of
                 intelligence have their analogs in distinct brain networks.
                 Using simulations based on neuroimaging data, we show that the
                 higher-order factor ``g'' is accounted for by cognitive tasks
                 corecruiting multiple networks. Finally, we confirm the
                 independence of these components of intelligence by
                 dissociating them using questionnaire variables. We propose
                 that intelligence is an emergent property of anatomically
                 distinct cognitive systems, each of which has its own

                 have different effects on affective and cognitive well-being
                 and (b) how the rate of adaptation varies across different

                 samples, N = 65,911) were integrated to describe the reaction
                 and adaptation to 4 family events (marriage, divorce,

                 show that life events have very different effects on affective

                 their effects on SWB, but these effects are not a function of

  abstract  = "During the past decade there has been an explosion in
               computation and information technology. With it have come vast
               amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine,
               biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding
               these data has led to the development of new tools in the field
               of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining,
               machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have
               common underpinnings but are often expressed with different
               terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these
               areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is
               statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than
               mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of
               color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and
               anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The
               book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction)
               to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural
               networks, support vector machines, classification trees and
               boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in
               any book.This major new edition features many topics not covered
               in the original, including graphical models, random forests,
               ensemble methods, least angle regression \& path algorithms for
               the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral
               clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data
               (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false
               discovery rates.",

  abstract    = "Positions on the ethics of human enhancement technologies can
                 be (crudely) characterized as ranging from transhumanism to
                 bioconservatism. Transhumanists believe that human enhancement
                 technologies should be made widely available, that individuals
                 should have broad discretion over which of these technologies
                 to apply to themselves, and that parents should normally have
                 the right to choose enhancements for their children-to-be.
                 Bioconservatives (whose ranks include such diverse writers as
                 Leon Kass, Francis Fukuyama, George Annas, Wesley Smith,
                 Jeremy Rifkin, and Bill McKibben) are generally opposed to the
                 use of technology to modify human nature. A central idea in
                 bioconservativism is that human enhancement technologies will
                 undermine our human dignity. To forestall a slide down the
                 slippery slope towards an ultimately debased 'posthuman'
                 state, bioconservatives often argue for broad bans on
                 otherwise promising human enhancements. This paper
                 distinguishes two common fears about the posthuman and argues
                 for the importance of a concept of dignity that is inclusive
                 enough to also apply to many possible posthuman beings.
                 Recognizing the possibility of posthuman dignity undercuts an
                 important objection against human enhancement and removes a
                 distortive double standard from our field of moral vision.",

              This might simply allow for an improved form of communication. At
              the other extreme, it might merge the minds into one in a process
              that can be thought of as a reverse split-brain operation. We
              propose that one way mind coalescence might happen is via an
              exocortex, a prosthetic extension of the biological brain which
              integrates with the brain as seamlessly as parts of the
              biological brain integrate with each other. An exocortex may also
              prove to be the easiest route for mind uploading, as a person's
              personality gradually moves away from the aging biological brain
              onto the exocortex. Memories might also be copied and shared even
              without minds being permanently merged. Over time, the borders of
              personal identity may become loose or even unnecessary.",

               living happy lives could be sustained in the accessible region
               of the universe. For every year that development of such
               technologies and colonization of the universe is delayed, there
               is therefore a corresponding opportunity cost: a potential good,
               lives worth living, is not being realized. Given some plausible
               assumptions, this cost is extremely large. However, the lesson
               for standard utilitarians is not that we ought to maximize the
               pace of technological development, but rather that we ought to
               maximize its safety, i.e. the probability that colonization will
               eventually occur. This goal has such high utility that standard
               utilitarians ought to focus all their efforts on it.
               Utilitarians of a stripe should accept a modified version of
               this conclusion. Some mixed ethical views, which combine

  title    = "A Formal Theory of Inductive Inference. {P}art {I}",
  author   = "Solomonoff, Ray J",
  abstract = "1. Summary In Part I, four ostensibly different theoretical
              models of induction are presented, in which the problem dealt
              with is the extrapolation of a very long sequence of
              symbols---presumably containing all of the information to be used
              in the induction. Almost all, if not all problems in induction
              can be put in this form. Some strong heuristic arguments have
              been obtained for the equivalence of the last three models. One
              of these models is equivalent to a Bayes formulation, in which a
              priori probabilities are assigned to sequences of symbols on the
              basis of the lengths of inputs to a universal Turing machine that
              are required to produce the sequence of interest as output.
              Though it seems likely, it is not certain whether the first of
              the four models is equivalent to the other three. Few rigorous
              results are presented. Informal investigations are made of the
              properties of these models. There are discussions of their
              consistency and meaningfulness, of their degree of independence
              of the exact nature of the Turing machine used, and of the
              accuracy of their predictions in comparison to those of other
              induction methods. In Part II these models are applied to the
              solution of three problems---prediction of the Bernoulli
              sequence, extrapolation of a certain kind of Markov chain, and
              the use of phrase structure grammars for induction. Though some
              approximations are used, the first of these problems is treated
              most rigorously. The result is Laplace's rule of succession. The
              solution to the second problem uses less certain approximations,
              but the properties of the solution that are discussed, are fairly
              independent of these approximations. The third application, using
              phrase structure grammars, is least exact of the three. First a
              formal solution is presented. Though it appears to have certain
              deficiencies, it is hoped that presentation of this admittedly
              inadequate model will suggest acceptable improvements in it. This
              formal solution is then applied in an approximate way to the
              determination of the ``optimum'' phrase structure grammar for a
              given set of strings. The results that are obtained are
              plausible, but subject to the uncertainties of the approximation
              used.",

              advantage over humans. Hardware advantages include greater serial
              speeds and greater parallel speeds. Self-improvement advantages

              computational limitations and faulty heuristics, human-centric
              biases, and socially motivated cognition. The shape of hardware
              growth curves, as well as the ease of modifying minds, are found

              evolutionary processes produced human intelligence on Earth, it
              should be feasible for clever human engineers to create
              human-level artificial intelligence in the not-too-distant
              future. This evolutionary argument, however, has ignored the
              observation selection effect that guarantees that observers will
              see intelligent life having arisen on their planet no matter how
              hard it is for intelligent life to evolve on any given Earth-like
              planet. We explore how the evolutionary argument might be
              salvaged from this objection, using a variety of considerations
              from observation selection theory and analysis of specific timing
              features and instances of convergent evolution in the terrestrial
              evolutionary record. We find that, depending on the resolution of
              disputed questions in observation selection theory, the objection
              can either be wholly or moderately defused, although other
              challenges for the evolutionary argument remain.",

                   scenario in which technological advances virtually explode.
                   The most popular scenario is the creation of
                   super-intelligent algorithms that recursively create ever
                   higher intelligences. It took many decades for these ideas
                   to spread from science fiction to popular science magazines
                   and finally to attract the attention of serious
                   philosophers. David Chalmers' (JCS 2010) article is the
                   first comprehensive philosophical analysis of the
                   singularity in a respected philosophy journal. The
                   motivation of my article is to augment Chalmers' and to
                   discuss some issues not addressed by him, in particular what
                   it could mean for intelligence to explode. In this course, I
                   will (have to) provide a more careful treatment of what
                   intelligence actually is, separate speed from intelligence
                   explosion, compare what super-intelligent participants and
                   classical human observers might experience and do, discuss
                   immediate implications for the diversity and value of life,

               the doomsday argument by appealing to the self-indication
               assumption (SIA) that your very existence gives you reason to
               think that there are many observers. Unlike earlier users of
               this strategy, Olum tries to counter objections that have been
               made against (SIA). We argue that his defence of (SIA) is
               unsuccessful. This does not, however, mean that one has to
               accept the doomsday argument (or the other counter-intuitive
               results that flow from related thought-experiments). A developed
               theory of observation selection effects shows why the doomsday
               argument is inconclusive, and how one can consistently reject
               both it and (SIA).",

  author   = "Lenat, Douglas B and Brown, John Seely",
  abstract = "The am program was constructed by Lenat in 1975 as an early
              experiment in getting machines to learn by discovery. In the
              preceding article in this issue of the AI Journal, Ritchie and
              Hanna focus on that work as they raise several fundamental
              questions about the methodology of artificial intelligence
              research. Part of this paper is a response to the specific points
              they make. It is seen that the difficulties they cite fall into
              four categories, the most serious of which are omitted
              heuristics, and the most common of which are miscommunications.
              Their considerations, and our post-am work on machines that
              learn, have clarified why am succeeded in the first place, and
              why it was so difficult to use the same paradigm to discover new
              heuristics. Those recent insights spawn questions about ``where
              the meaning really resides'' in the concepts discovered by am.
              This in turn leads to an appreciation of the crucial and unique
              role of representation in theory formation, specifically the
              benefits of having syntax mirror semantics. Some criticism of the
              paradigm of this work arises due to the ad hoc nature of many
              pieces of the work; at the end of this article we examine how
              this very adhocracy may be a potential source of power in itself.",

  abstract = "Take the idea of exponential technological growth, work it
              through to its logical conclusion, and there you have the
              singularity. Its bold incredibility pushes aside incredulity, as
              it challenges us to confront all the things we thought could
              never come true - the creation of super intelligent, conscious
              organisms, nanorobots that can swim in our bloodstreams and fix
              what ails us, and direct communication from mind to mind. And the
              piece de resistance: a posthuman existence of disembodied
              uploaded minds, living on indefinitely without fear, sickness, or
              want in a virtual paradise ingeniously designed to delight,
              thrill, and stimulate. This vision argues that machines will
              become conscious and then perfect themselves, as described
              elsewhere in this issue. Yet for all its show of tough- minded
              audacity, the argument is shot through with sloppy reasoning,
              wishful thinking, and irresponsibility. Infatuated with
              statistics and seduced by the power of extrapolation,
              singularitarians abduct the moral imagination into a speculative
              no-man's-land. To be sure, they are hardly the first to spread
              fanciful technological prophecies, but among enthusiasts and
              doomsayers alike their proposition enjoys an inexplicable
              popularity. Perhaps the real question is how they have gotten

              increasingly raising ethical implications, related to the more
              strict interaction between robots and human beings, as well as to
              the ever closest interaction between robotics itself and
              biological science. Progress in the field of computer science and
              telecommunications has allowed us to endow machines with enough
              intelligence so that they can act autonomously. However, as the
              application field for robots is widening and the robot is coming
              out of the factory halls, new challenges are seen both from the
              technical and the social point of view. Therefore, we can
              forecast that in our century humanity will coexist with the first

  abstract = "We investigate the role of networks of alliances in preventing
              (multilateral) interstate wars. We first show that, in the
              absence of international trade, no network of alliances is
              peaceful and stable. We then show that international trade
              induces peaceful and stable networks: Trade increases the density
              of alliances so that countries are less vulnerable to attack and
              also reduces countries’ incentives to attack an ally. We present
              historical data on wars and trade showing that the dramatic drop
              in interstate wars since 1950 is paralleled by a densification
              and stabilization of trading relationships and alliances. Based
              on the model we also examine some specific relationships, finding
              that countries with high levels of trade with their allies are
              less likely to be involved in wars with any other countries
              (including allies and nonallies), and that an increase in trade
              between two countries correlates with a lower chance that they
              will go to war with each other.",

                 components of foodstuffs affect health, relatively little is
                 known about a more fundamental aspect of diet, the frequency
                 and circadian timing of meals, and potential benefits of
                 intermittent periods with no or very low energy intakes. The
                 most common eating pattern in modern societies, three meals
                 plus snacks every day, is abnormal from an evolutionary
                 perspective. Emerging findings from studies of animal models
                 and human subjects suggest that intermittent energy
                 restriction periods of as little as 16 h can improve health
                 indicators and counteract disease processes. The mechanisms
                 involve a metabolic shift to fat metabolism and ketone
                 production, and stimulation of adaptive cellular stress
                 responses that prevent and repair molecular damage. As data on

              explanation. We present a computational model that captures these
              human learning abilities for a large class of simple visual
              concepts: handwritten characters from the world’s alphabets. The
              model represents concepts as simple programs that best explain

                   observable universe, $p$ is the probability that a randomly
                   chosen such planet develops intelligent life to the level of
                   present-day human civilization, and $q$ is the conditional
                   probability that it then goes on to develop a technological
                   supercivilization visible all over the observable universe.
                   Evidence suggests that $N$ is huge, which implies that $pq$
                   is very small. Hanson (1998) and Bostrom (2008) have argued

                   towards $p$ not being small and therefore a very small $q$,

               life were a randomly selected member of some appropriate
               reference class of observer-moments. We do not need to use

               hypothetical prior based upon the SSSA in order to estimate
               probabilities. But we need to make the SSSA precise. We specify
               exactly what is and what is not an observer, how to choose a
               reference class and how to select a prior probability
               distribution that can be used when selecting randomly from the

  abstract  = "A primary motivation for reasoning under uncertainty is to
               derive decisions in the face of inconclusive evidence. Shafer's
               theory of belief functions, which explicity represents the
               underconstrained nature of many reasoning problems, lacks a
               formal procedure for making decisions. Clearly, when sufficient
               information is not available, no theory can prescribe actions
               without making additional assumptions. Faced with this
               situation, some assumption must be made if a clearly superior
               choice is to emerge. This paper offers a probabilistic
               interpretation of a simple assumption that disambiguates
               decision problems represented with belief functions. It is
               proved that it yields expected values identical to those
               obtained by a probabilistic analysis that makes the same
               assumption. A strict separation is maintained between evidence
               that carries information about a situation and assumptions that
               may be made for disambiguation of choices. In addition, it is
               shown how the decision analysis methodology frequently employed
               in probabilistic reasoning can be extended for use with belief
               functions. This generalization of decision analysis allows the
               use of belief functions within the familiar framework of
               decision trees.",

  author        = "Aaronson, Scott and Christiano, Paul",
  abstract      = "Forty years ago, Wiesner pointed out that quantum mechanics
                   raises the striking possibility of money that cannot be
                   counterfeited according to the laws of physics. We propose
                   the first quantum money scheme that is (1) public-key,
                   meaning that anyone can verify a banknote as genuine, not
                   only the bank that printed it, and (2) cryptographically
                   secure, under a ``classical'' hardness assumption that has
                   nothing to do with quantum money. Our scheme is based on
                   hidden subspaces, encoded as the zero-sets of random
                   multivariate polynomials. A main technical advance is to
                   show that the ``black-box'' version of our scheme, where the
                   polynomials are replaced by classical oracles, is
                   unconditionally secure. Previously, such a result had only
                   been known relative to a quantum oracle (and even there, the
                   proof was never published). Even in Wiesner's original
                   setting -- quantum money that can only be verified by the
                   bank -- we are able to use our techniques to patch a major
                   security hole in Wiesner's scheme. We give the first
                   private-key quantum money scheme that allows unlimited
                   verifications and that remains unconditionally secure, even
                   if the counterfeiter can interact adaptively with the bank.
                   Our money scheme is simpler than previous public-key quantum
                   money schemes, including a knot-based scheme of Farhi et al.
                   The verifier needs to perform only two tests, one in the
                   standard basis and one in the Hadamard basis -- matching the
                   original intuition for quantum money, based on the existence
                   of complementary observables. Our security proofs use a new
                   variant of Ambainis's quantum adversary method, and several
                   other tools that might be of independent interest.",

  abstract      = "In many online learning problems we are interested in
                   predicting local information about some universe of items.
                   For example, we may want to know whether two items are in
                   the same cluster rather than computing an assignment of
                   items to clusters; we may want to know which of two teams
                   will win a game rather than computing a ranking of teams.
                   Although finding the optimal clustering or ranking is
                   typically intractable, it may be possible to predict the
                   relationships between items as well as if you could solve
                   the global optimization problem exactly. Formally, we
                   consider an online learning problem in which a learner
                   repeatedly guesses a pair of labels (l(x), l(y)) and
                   receives an adversarial payoff depending on those labels.
                   The learner's goal is to receive a payoff nearly as good as
                   the best fixed labeling of the items. We show that a simple
                   algorithm based on semidefinite programming can obtain
                   asymptotically optimal regret in the case where the number
                   of possible labels is O(1), resolving an open problem posed
                   by Hazan, Kale, and Shalev-Schwartz. Our main technical
                   contribution is a novel use and analysis of the log
                   determinant regularizer, exploiting the observation that log
                   det(A + I) upper bounds the entropy of any distribution with

                   interact with each other, while limiting the damage done by
                   each malicious or incompetent user. The worst-case cost per
                   user is sublinear in the average number of interactions per
                   user and is independent of the number of users. Our
                   guarantee holds simultaneously for every group of honest
                   users. For example, multiple groups of users with
                   incompatible tastes or preferences can coexist. As a
                   motivating example, we consider a game where players have

                   are no more fundamentally special than rocks or clouds. It
                   isn't trivial to find a decision-theoretic foundation for
                   game theory in which an agent's coplayers are a
                   non-distinguished part of the agent's environment. Attempts
                   to model both players and the environment as Turing
                   machines, for example, fail for standard diagonalization
                   reasons. In this paper, we introduce a ``reflective'' type
                   of oracle, which is able to answer questions about the
                   outputs of oracle machines with access to the same oracle.
                   These oracles avoid diagonalization by answering some
                   queries randomly. We show that machines with access to a
                   reflective oracle can be used to define rational agents
                   using causal decision theory. These agents model their
                   environment as a probabilistic oracle machine, which may
                   contain other agents as a non-distinguished part. We show
                   that if such agents interact, they will play a Nash
                   equilibrium, with the randomization in mixed strategies
                   coming from the randomization in the oracle's answers. This
                   can be seen as providing a foundation for classical game

  author    = "Chalmers, David J",
  abstract  = "What is consciousness? How do physical processes in the brain
               give rise to the self-aware mind and to feelings as profoundly
               varied as love or hate, aesthetic pleasure or spiritual
               yearning? These questions today are among the most hotly debated
               issues among scientists and philosophers, and we have seen in
               recent years superb volumes by such eminent figures as Francis
               Crick, Daniel C. Dennett, Gerald Edelman, and Roger Penrose, all
               firing volleys in what has come to be called the consciousness
               wars. Now, in The Conscious Mind, philosopher David J. Chalmers
               offers a cogent analysis of this heated debate as he unveils a
               major new theory of consciousness, one that rejects the
               prevailing reductionist trend of science, while offering
               provocative insights into the relationship between mind and
               brain.Writing in a rigorous, thought-provoking style, the author
               takes us on a far-reaching tour through the philosophical
               ramifications of consciousness. Chalmers convincingly reveals
               how contemporary cognitive science and neurobiology have failed
               to explain how and why mental events emerge from physiological
               occurrences in the brain. He proposes instead that conscious
               experience must be understood in an entirely new light--as an
               irreducible entity (similar to such physical properties as time,
               mass, and space) that exists at a fundamental level and cannot
               be understood as the sum of its parts. And after suggesting some
               intriguing possibilities about the structure and laws of
               conscious experience, he details how his unique reinterpretation
               of the mind could be the focus of a new science. Throughout the
               book, Chalmers provides fascinating thought experiments that
               trenchantly illustrate his ideas. For example, in exploring the
               notion that consciousness could be experienced by machines as
               well as humans, Chalmers asks us to imagine a thinking brain in
               which neurons are slowly replaced by silicon chips that
               precisely duplicate their functions--as the neurons are
               replaced, will consciousness gradually fade away? The book also
               features thoughtful discussions of how the author's theories
               might be practically applied to subjects as diverse as
               artificial intelligence and the interpretation of quantum
               mechanics.All of us have pondered the nature and meaning of
               consciousness. Engaging and penetrating, The Conscious Mind adds
               a fresh new perspective to the subject that is sure to spark
               debate about our understanding of the mind for years to come.",

                 potent selective antagonists of Nav1.7 are weak analgesics. We
                 investigated whether Nav1.7, as well as contributing to
                 electrical signalling, may have additional functions. Here we
                 report that Nav1.7 deletion has profound effects on gene
                 expression, leading to an upregulation of enkephalin precursor
                 Penk mRNA and met-enkephalin protein in sensory neurons. In
                 contrast, Nav1.8-null mutant sensory neurons show no
                 upregulated Penk mRNA expression. Application of the opioid
                 antagonist naloxone potentiates noxious peripheral input into
                 the spinal cord and dramatically reduces analgesia in both
                 female and male Nav1.7-null mutant mice, as well as in a human
                 Nav1.7-null mutant. These data suggest that Nav1.7 channel
                 blockers alone may not replicate the analgesic phenotype of
                 null mutant humans and mice, but may be potentiated with
                 exogenous opioids.",

  abstract = "Abstract A folk assumption about colloquial speech is that taboo
              words are used because speakers cannot find better words with
              which to express themselves: because speakers lack vocabulary. A
              competing possibility is that fluency is fluency regardless of
              subject matter---that there is no reason to propose a difference
              in lexicon size and ease of access for taboo as opposed to
              emotionally-neutral words. In order to test these hypotheses, we
              compared general verbal fluency via the Controlled Oral Word
              Association Test (COWAT) with taboo word fluency and animal word
              fluency in spoken and written formats. Both formats produced
              positive correlations between COWAT fluency, animal fluency, and
              taboo word fluency, supporting the fluency-is-fluency hypothesis.
              In each study, a set of 10 taboo words accounted for 55--60\% of
              all taboo word data. Expressives were generated at higher rates
              than slurs. There was little sex-related variability in taboo
              word generation, and, consistent with findings that do not show a
              sex difference in taboo lexicon size, no overall sex difference
              in taboo word generation was obtained. Taboo fluency was
              positively correlated with the Big Five personality traits
              neuroticism and openness and negatively correlated with
              agreeableness and conscientiousness. Overall the findings suggest
              that, with the exception of female-sex-related slurs, taboo
              expressives and general pejoratives comprise the core of the
              category of taboo words while slurs tend to occupy the periphery,
              and the ability to generate taboo language is not an index of
              overall language poverty.",

                   considerable computational advantage. For a crafted problem
                   designed to have tall and narrow energy barriers separating
                   local minima, the D-Wave 2X quantum annealer achieves
                   significant runtime advantages relative to Simulated

                   results in a

                   $\textbackslash{}sim 10^8$ times faster than SA running on a

                 feelings. Using computational modeling, we show that emotional
                 reactivity in the form of momentary happiness in response to
                 outcomes of a probabilistic reward task is explained not by
                 current task earnings, but by the combined influence of recent
                 reward expectations and prediction errors arising from those
                 expectations. The robustness of this account was evident in a
                 large-scale replication involving 18,420 participants. Using
                 functional MRI, we show that the very same influences account
                 for task-dependent striatal activity in a manner akin to the
                 influences underpinning changes in happiness.",

                 knowledge that is used by the human brain for processing
                 verbal and nonverbal inputs and for language production.
                 Although considerable work has been done on modeling human
                 language abilities, it has been difficult to bring them
                 together to a comprehensive tabula rasa system compatible with
                 current knowledge of how verbal information is processed in
                 the brain. This work presents a cognitive system, entirely
                 based on a large-scale neural architecture, which was
                 developed to shed light on the procedural knowledge involved
                 in language elaboration. The main component of this system is
                 the central executive, which is a supervising system that
                 coordinates the other components of the working memory. In our
                 model, the central executive is a neural network that takes as
                 input the neural activation states of the short-term memory
                 and yields as output mental actions, which control the flow of
                 information among the working memory components through neural
                 gating mechanisms. The proposed system is capable of learning
                 to communicate through natural language starting from tabula
                 rasa, without any a priori knowledge of the structure of
                 phrases, meaning of words, role of the different classes of
                 words, only by interacting with a human through a text-based
                 interface, using an open-ended incremental learning process.
                 It is able to learn nouns, verbs, adjectives, pronouns and
                 other word classes, and to use them in expressive language.
                 The model was validated on a corpus of 1587 input sentences,
                 based on literature on early language assessment, at the level
                 of about 4-years old child, and produced 521 output sentences,

                   similar systems where a pair of planets may reside entirely
                   in the habitable zone of the hosting star. Specifically, we
                   run numerical simulations to determine whether strong,
                   resonant (or non-resonant) planet-planet interactions can
                   cause large variations in planet obliquity---thereby
                   inducing large variations in climate. We also determine
                   whether or not resonant interactions affect the rate of
                   lithopanspermia between the planet pair---which could
                   facilitate the growth and maintenance of life on both
                   planets. We find that first-order resonances do not cause
                   larger obliquity variations compared with non-resonant
                   cases. We also find that resonant interactions are not a
                   primary consideration in lithopanspermia. Lithopanspermia is
                   enhanced significantly as the planet orbits come closer
                   together---reaching nearly the same rate as ejected material
                   falling back to the surface of the originating planet
                   (assuming that the ejected material makes it out to the
                   location of our initial conditions). Thus, in both cases our
                   results indicate that close-proximity planet pairs in
                   multihabitable systems are conducive to life in the system.",

               status than animals is the superior cognitive capacity of
               humans. People with profound mental retardation pose a problem

               not superior to those of many animals. I argue that we should

                 is a dissipative process. A minimal quantity of heat,
                 proportional to the thermal energy and called the Landauer
                 bound, is necessarily produced when a classical bit of
                 information is deleted. A direct consequence of this logically
                 irreversible transformation is that the entropy of the
                 environment increases by a finite amount. Despite its
                 fundamental importance for information theory and computer
                 science, the erasure principle has not been verified
                 experimentally so far, the main obstacle being the difficulty
                 of doing single-particle experiments in the low-dissipation
                 regime. Here we experimentally show the existence of the
                 Landauer bound in a generic model of a one-bit memory. Using a
                 system of a single colloidal particle trapped in a modulated
                 double-well potential, we establish that the mean dissipated
                 heat saturates at the Landauer bound in the limit of long
                 erasure cycles. This result demonstrates the intimate link
                 between information theory and thermodynamics. It further

              the thermodynamics of information processing, holds that any
              logically irreversible manipulation of information, such as the
              erasure of a bit or the merging of two computation paths, must be
              accompanied by a corresponding entropy increase in
              non-information-bearing degrees of freedom of the
              information-processing apparatus or its environment. Conversely,
              it is generally accepted that any logically reversible
              transformation of information can in principle be accomplished by
              an appropriate physical mechanism operating in a
              thermodynamically reversible fashion. These notions have
              sometimes been criticized either as being false, or as being
              trivial and obvious, and therefore unhelpful for purposes such as
              explaining why Maxwell's Demon cannot violate the second law of
              thermodynamics. Here I attempt to refute some of the arguments
              against Landauer's principle, while arguing that although in a
              sense it is indeed a straightforward consequence or restatement
              of the Second Law, it still has considerable pedagogic and
              explanatory power, especially in the context of other influential

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Data on resting heart rate and risk of all-cause
                 and cardiovascular mortality are inconsistent; the magnitude
                 of associations between resting heart rate and risk of
                 all-cause and cardiovascular mortality varies across studies.
                 We performed a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies to
                 quantitatively evaluate the associations in the general
                 population. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase and MEDLINE
                 from inception to Jan. 1, 2015. We used a random-effects model
                 to combine study-specific relative risks and 95\% confidence
                 intervals (CIs). We used restricted cubic spline functions to
                 assess the dose-response relation. RESULTS: A total of 46
                 studies were included in the meta-analysis, involving 1 246
                 203 patients and 78 349 deaths for all-cause mortality, and
                 848 320 patients and 25 800 deaths for cardiovascular
                 mortality. The relative risk with 10 beats/min increment of
                 resting heart rate was 1.09 (95\% CI 1.07-1.12) for all-cause
                 mortality and 1.08 (95\% CI 1.06-1.10) for cardiovascular
                 mortality. Compared with the lowest category, patients with a
                 resting heart rate of 60-80 beats/min had a relative risk of
                 1.12 (95\% CI 1.07-1.17) for all-cause mortality and 1.08
                 (95\% CI 0.99-1.17) for cardiovascular mortality, and those
                 with a resting heart rate of greater than 80 beats/min had a
                 relative risk of 1.45 (95\% CI 1.34-1.57) for all-cause
                 mortality and 1.33 (95\% CI 1.19-1.47) for cardiovascular
                 mortality. Overall, the results did not differ after
                 adjustment for traditional risk factors for cardiovascular
                 disease. Compared with 45 beats/min, the risk of all-cause
                 mortality increased significantly with increasing resting
                 heart rate in a linear relation, but a significantly increased
                 risk of cardiovascular mortality was observed at 90 beats/min.
                 Substantial heterogeneity and publication bias were detected.
                 INTERPRETATION: Higher resting heart rate was independently
                 associated with increased risks of all-cause and
                 cardiovascular mortality. This indicates that resting heart
                 rate is a predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality
                 in the general population.",

  abstract      = "The ability to predict future states of the environment is a
                   central pillar of intelligence. At its core, effective
                   prediction requires an internal model of the world and an
                   understanding of the rules by which the world changes. Here,
                   we explore the internal models developed by deep neural
                   networks trained using a loss based on predicting future
                   frames in synthetic video sequences, using an
                   Encoder-Recurrent-Decoder framework (Fragkiadaki et al.,
                   2015). We first show that this architecture can achieve
                   excellent performance in visual sequence prediction tasks,
                   including state-of-the-art performance in a standard
                   'bouncing balls' dataset (Sutskever et al., 2009). We then
                   train on clips of out-of-the-plane rotations of
                   computer-generated faces, using both mean-squared error and
                   a generative adversarial loss (Goodfellow et al., 2014),
                   extending the latter to a recurrent, conditional setting.
                   Despite being trained end-to-end to predict only pixel-level
                   information, our Predictive Generative Networks learn a
                   representation of the latent variables of the underlying
                   generative process. Importantly, we find that this
                   representation is naturally tolerant to object
                   transformations, and generalizes well to new tasks, such as
                   classification of static images. Similar models trained
                   solely with a reconstruction loss fail to generalize as
                   effectively. We argue that prediction can serve as a
                   powerful unsupervised loss for learning rich internal
                   representations of high-level object features.",

                 supporting the ability to sustain positive emotional responses
                 are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the neural
                 correlates associated with the persistence of positive affect
                 in the real world by conducting two experiments in humans: an
                 fMRI task of reward responses and an experience-sampling task
                 measuring emotional responses to a reward obtained in the
                 field. The magnitude of DLPFC engagement to rewards
                 administered in the laboratory predicted reactivity of
                 real-world positive emotion following a reward administered in
                 the field. Sustained ventral striatum engagement in the
                 laboratory positively predicted the duration of real-world
                 positive emotional responses. These results suggest that
                 common pathways are associated with the unfolding of neural
                 processes over seconds and with the dynamics of emotions
                 experienced over minutes. Examining such dynamics may
                 facilitate a better understanding of the brain-behavior
                 associations underlying emotion. Significance statement: How
                 real-world emotion, experienced over seconds, minutes, and
                 hours, is instantiated in the brain over the course of
                 milliseconds and seconds is unknown. We combined a novel,
                 real-world experience-sampling task with fMRI to examine how
                 individual differences in real-world emotion, experienced over
                 minutes and hours, is subserved by affective neurodynamics of
                 brain activity over the course of seconds. When winning money
                 in the real world, individuals sustaining positive emotion the
                 longest were those with the most prolonged ventral striatal
                 activity. These results suggest that common pathways are
                 associated with the unfolding of neural processes over seconds
                 and with the dynamics of emotions experienced over minutes.

                 debilitating effects of dialysis, because of a shortage of
                 transplant kidneys. To reduce this shortage, many advocate
                 having the government compensate kidney donors. This paper
                 presents a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of such a
                 change. It considers not only the substantial savings to
                 society because kidney recipients would no longer need
                 expensive dialysis treatments-$1.45 million per kidney
                 recipient-but also estimates the monetary value of the longer
                 and healthier lives that kidney recipients enjoy-about $1.3
                 million per recipient. These numbers dwarf the proposed $45

                   It is a mystery how neurons integrate the input from so many
                   synapses and what kind of large-scale network behavior this
                   enables. It has been previously proposed that non-linear
                   properties of dendrites enable neurons to recognize multiple
                   patterns. In this paper we extend this idea by showing that
                   a neuron with several thousand synapses arranged along
                   active dendrites can learn to accurately and robustly
                   recognize hundreds of unique patterns of cellular activity,
                   even in the presence of large amounts of noise and pattern
                   variation. We then propose a neuron model where some of the
                   patterns recognized by a neuron lead to action potentials
                   and define the classic receptive field of the neuron,
                   whereas the majority of the patterns recognized by a neuron
                   act as predictions by slightly depolarizing the neuron
                   without immediately generating an action potential. We then
                   present a network model based on neurons with these
                   properties and show that the network learns a robust model
                   of time-based sequences. Given the similarity of excitatory
                   neurons throughout the neocortex and the importance of
                   sequence memory in inference and behavior, we propose that
                   this form of sequence memory is a universal property of
                   neocortical tissue. We further propose that cellular layers
                   in the neocortex implement variations of the same sequence
                   memory algorithm to achieve different aspects of inference
                   and behavior. The neuron and network models we introduce are
                   robust over a wide range of parameters as long as the
                   network uses a sparse distributed code of cellular
                   activations. The sequence capacity of the network scales
                   linearly with the number of synapses on each neuron. Thus
                   neurons need thousands of synapses to learn the many
                   temporal patterns in sensory stimuli and motor sequences.",

                   Predictions for Unrecognizable Images",
  author        = "Nguyen, Anh and Yosinski, Jason and Clune, Jeff",
  abstract      = "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently been achieving
                   state-of-the-art performance on a variety of
                   pattern-recognition tasks, most notably visual
                   classification problems. Given that DNNs are now able to
                   classify objects in images with near-human-level
                   performance, questions naturally arise as to what
                   differences remain between computer and human vision. A
                   recent study revealed that changing an image (e.g. of a
                   lion) in a way imperceptible to humans can cause a DNN to
                   label the image as something else entirely (e.g. mislabeling
                   a lion a library). Here we show a related result: it is easy
                   to produce images that are completely unrecognizable to
                   humans, but that state-of-the-art DNNs believe to be
                   recognizable objects with 99.99\% confidence (e.g. labeling
                   with certainty that white noise static is a lion).
                   Specifically, we take convolutional neural networks trained
                   to perform well on either the ImageNet or MNIST datasets and
                   then find images with evolutionary algorithms or gradient
                   ascent that DNNs label with high confidence as belonging to
                   each dataset class. It is possible to produce images totally
                   unrecognizable to human eyes that DNNs believe with near
                   certainty are familiar objects, which we call ``fooling
                   images'' (more generally, fooling examples). Our results
                   shed light on interesting differences between human vision
                   and current DNNs, and raise questions about the generality
                   of DNN computer vision.",

  author   = "Smart, John M",
  abstract = "The emerging science of evolutionary developmental (``evo devo'')
              biology can aid us in thinking about our universe as both an
              evolutionary system, where most processes are unpredictable and
              creative, and a developmental system, where a special few
              processes are predictable and constrained to produce
              far-future-specific emergent order, just as we see in the common
              developmental processes in two stars of an identical population
              type, or in two genetically identical twins in biology. The
              transcension hypothesis proposes that a universal process of
              evolutionary development guides all sufficiently advanced
              civilizations into what may be called ``inner space,'' a
              computationally optimal domain of increasingly dense, productive,
              miniaturized, and efficient scales of space, time, energy, and
              matter, and eventually, to a black-hole-like destination.
              Transcension as a developmental destiny might also contribute to
              the solution to the Fermi paradox, the question of why we have
              not seen evidence of or received beacons from intelligent
              civilizations. A few potential evolutionary, developmental, and
              information theoretic reasons, mechanisms, and models for
              constrained transcension of advanced intelligence are briefly
              considered. In particular, we introduce arguments that black
              holes may be a developmental destiny and standard attractor for
              all higher intelligence, as they appear to some to be ideal
              computing, learning, forward time travel, energy harvesting,
              civilization merger, natural selection, and universe replication
              devices. In the transcension hypothesis, simpler civilizations
              that succeed in resisting transcension by staying in outer
              (normal) space would be developmental failures, which are
              statistically very rare late in the life cycle of any biological
              developing system. If transcension is a developmental process, we
              may expect brief broadcasts or subtle forms of galactic
              engineering to occur in small portions of a few galaxies, the
              handiwork of young and immature civilizations, but constrained
              transcension should be by far the norm for all mature
              civilizations. The transcension hypothesis has significant and
              testable implications for our current and future METI and SETI
              agendas. If all universal intelligence eventually transcends to
              black-hole-like environments, after which some form of merger and
              selection occurs, and if two-way messaging (a send--receive
              cycle) is severely limited by the great distances between
              neighboring and rapidly transcending civilizations, then sending
              one-way METI or probes prior to transcension becomes the only
              real communication option. But one-way messaging or probes may
              provably reduce the evolutionary diversity in all civilizations
              receiving the message, as they would then arrive at their local
              transcensions in a much more homogenous fashion. If true, an
              ethical injunction against one-way messaging or probes might
              emerge in the morality and sustainability systems of all
              sufficiently advanced civilizations, an argument known as the Zoo
              hypothesis in Fermi paradox literature, if all higher
              intelligences are subject to an evolutionary attractor to
              maximize their local diversity, and a developmental attractor to
              merge and advance universal intelligence. In any such
              environment, the evolutionary value of sending any interstellar
              message or probe may simply not be worth the cost, if
              transcension is an inevitable, accelerative, and testable
              developmental process, one that eventually will be discovered and
              quantitatively described by future physics. Fortunately,
              transcension processes may be measurable today even without good
              physical theory, and radio and optical SETI may each provide
              empirical tests. If transcension is a universal developmental
              constraint, then without exception all early and low-power
              electromagnetic leakage signals (radar, radio, television), and
              later, optical evidence of the exoplanets and their atmospheres
              should reliably cease as each civilization enters its own
              technological singularities (emergence of postbiological
              intelligence and life forms) and recognizes that they are on an
              optimal and accelerating path to a black-hole-like environment.
              Furthermore, optical SETI may soon allow us to map an expanding
              area of the galactic habitable zone we may call the galactic
              transcension zone, an inner ring that contains older transcended
              civilizations, and a missing planets problem as we discover that
              planets with life signatures occur at a much lower frequencies in
              this inner ring than in the remainder of the habitable zone.",

                 arguments for the morality of their respective political
                 positions. However, research suggests such moral rhetoric is
                 largely ineffective for persuading those who do not already
                 hold one's position because advocates advancing these
                 arguments fail to account for the divergent moral commitments
                 that undergird America's political divisions. Building on
                 this, we hypothesize that (a) political advocates
                 spontaneously make arguments grounded in their own moral
                 values, not the values of those targeted for persuasion, and
                 (b) political arguments reframed to appeal to the moral values
                 of those holding the opposing political position are typically
                 more effective. We find support for these claims across six

  abstract    = "IMPORTANCE: Thousands of physicians attend scientific meetings
                 annually. Although hospital physician staffing and composition
                 may be affected by meetings, patient outcomes and treatment
                 patterns during meeting dates are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To
                 analyze mortality and treatment differences among patients
                 admitted with acute cardiovascular conditions during dates of
                 national cardiology meetings compared with nonmeeting dates.
                 DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective analysis of
                 30-day mortality among Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized
                 with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure, or
                 cardiac arrest from 2002 through 2011 during dates of 2
                 national cardiology meetings compared with identical
                 nonmeeting days in the 3 weeks before and after conferences
                 (AMI, 8570 hospitalizations during 82 meeting days and 57,471
                 during 492 nonmeeting days; heart failure, 19,282 during
                 meeting days and 11,4591 during nonmeeting days; cardiac
                 arrest, 1564 during meeting days and 9580 during nonmeeting
                 days). Multivariable analyses were conducted separately for
                 major teaching hospitals and nonteaching hospitals and for
                 low- and high-risk patients. Differences in treatment
                 utilization were assessed. EXPOSURES: Hospitalization during
                 cardiology meeting dates. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:
                 Thirty-day mortality, procedure rates, charges, length of
                 stay. RESULTS: Patient characteristics were similar between
                 meeting and nonmeeting dates. In teaching hospitals, adjusted
                 30-day mortality was lower among high-risk patients with heart
                 failure or cardiac arrest admitted during meeting vs
                 nonmeeting dates (heart failure, 17.5\% [95\% CI,
                 13.7\%-21.2\%] vs 24.8\% [95\% CI, 22.9\%-26.6\%]; P < .001;
                 cardiac arrest, 59.1\% [95\% CI, 51.4\%-66.8\%] vs 69.4\%
                 [95\% CI, 66.2\%-72.6\%]; P = .01). Adjusted mortality for
                 high-risk AMI in teaching hospitals was similar between
                 meeting and nonmeeting dates (39.2\% [95\% CI, 31.8\%-46.6\%]
                 vs 38.5\% [95\% CI, 35.0\%-42.0\%]; P = .86), although
                 adjusted percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) rates were
                 lower during meetings (20.8\% vs 28.2\%; P = .02). No
                 mortality or utilization differences existed for low-risk
                 patients in teaching hospitals or high- or low-risk patients
                 in nonteaching hospitals. In sensitivity analyses, cardiac
                 mortality was not affected by hospitalization during oncology,
                 gastroenterology, and orthopedics meetings, nor was
                 gastrointestinal hemorrhage or hip fracture mortality affected
                 by hospitalization during cardiology meetings. CONCLUSIONS AND
                 RELEVANCE: High-risk patients with heart failure and cardiac
                 arrest hospitalized in teaching hospitals had lower 30-day
                 mortality when admitted during dates of national cardiology
                 meetings. High-risk patients with AMI admitted to teaching
                 hospitals during meetings were less likely to receive PCI,
                 without any mortality effect.",

  abstract  = "I argue against two popular claims. The first is a descriptive,
               empirical thesis about the nature of ordinary human experience:
               ‘each of us constructs and lives a ``narrative'' . . . this
               narrative is us, our identities’ (Oliver Sacks); ‘self is a
               perpetually rewritten story . . . in the end, we become the
               autobiographical narratives by which we ``tell about'' our
               lives’ (Jerry Bruner); ‘we are all virtuoso novelists. . . . We
               try to make all of our material cohere into a single good story.
               And that story is our autobiography. The chief fictional
               character . . . of that autobiography is one’s self’ (Dan
               Dennett). The second is a normative, ethical claim: we ought to
               live our lives narratively, or as a story; a ‘basic condition of
               making sense of ourselves is that we grasp our lives in a
               narrative’ and have an understanding of our lives ‘as an
               unfolding story’ (Charles Taylor). A person ‘creates his
               identity [only] by forming an autobiographical narrative -- a
               story of his life’, and must be in possession of a full and
               ‘explicit narrative [of his life] to develop fully as a person’

                 behaviour of a protein is encoded in its amino acid sequence.
                 Here, by synthesizing intrinsically disordered, repeat

                   aiming to distill the principles of intelligence that
                   operate independently of a specific problem domain or a
                   predefined context and utilize these principles in order to
                   synthesize systems capable of performing any intellectual
                   task a human being is capable of and eventually go beyond
                   that. While ``narrow'' artificial intelligence which focuses
                   on solving specific problems such as speech recognition,
                   text comprehension, visual pattern recognition, robotic
                   motion, etc. has shown quite a few impressive breakthroughs
                   lately, understanding general intelligence remains elusive.
                   In the paper we offer a novel theoretical approach to
                   understanding general intelligence. We start with a brief
                   introduction of the current conceptual approach. Our
                   critique exposes a number of serious limitations that are
                   traced back to the ontological roots of the concept of
                   intelligence. We then propose a paradigm shift from
                   intelligence perceived as a competence of individual agents
                   defined in relation to an a priori given problem domain or a
                   goal, to intelligence perceived as a formative process of
                   self-organization by which intelligent agents are
                   individuated. We call this process open-ended intelligence.
                   Open-ended intelligence is developed as an abstraction of
                   the process of cognitive development so its application can
                   be extended to general agents and systems. We introduce and
                   discuss three facets of the idea: the philosophical concept
                   of individuation, sense-making and the individuation of
                   general cognitive agents. We further show how open-ended
                   intelligence can be framed in terms of a distributed,
                   self-organizing network of interacting elements and how such
                   process is scalable. The framework highlights an important
                   relation between coordination and intelligence and a new
                   understanding of values. We conclude with a number of
                   questions for future research.",

  abstract    = "OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of
                 randomized trials that assessed the effect of testosterone use
                 on cardiovascular events and risk factors in men with
                 different degrees of androgen deficiency. METHODS:
                 Librarian-designed search strategies were used to search the
                 MEDLINE (1966 to October 2004), EMBASE (1988 to October 2004),
                 and Cochrane CENTRAL (inception to October 2004) databases.
                 The database search was performed again in March 2005. We also
                 reviewed reference lists from included studies and content
                 expert files. Eligible studies were randomized trials that
                 compared any formulation of commercially available
                 testosterone with placebo and that assessed cardiovascular
                 risk factors (lipid fractions, blood pressure, blood glucose),
                 cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, nonfatal
                 myocardial infarction, angina or claudication,
                 revascularization, stroke), and cardiovascular surrogate end
                 points (ie, laboratory tests indicative of cardiac or vascular
                 disease). Using a standardized data extraction form, we
                 collected data on participants, testosterone administration,
                 and outcome measures. We assessed study quality with attention
                 to allocation concealment, blinding, and loss to follow-up.
                 RESULTS: The 30 trials included 1642 men, 808 of whom were
                 treated with testosterone. Overall, the trials had limited
                 reporting of methodological features that prevent biased
                 results (only 6 trials reported allocation concealment),
                 enrolled few patients, and were of brief duration (only 4
                 trials followed up patients for > 1 year). The median loss to
                 follow-up across all 30 trials was 9\%. Testosterone use in
                 men with low testosterone levels led to inconsequential
                 changes in blood pressure and glycemia and in all lipid
                 fractions (total cholesterol: odds ratio [OR], -0.22; 95\%
                 confidence interval [CI], -0.71 to 0.27; high-density
                 lipoprotein cholesterol: OR, -0.04; 95\% CI, -0.39 to 0.30;
                 low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: OR, 0.06; 95\% CI, -0.30
                 to 0.42; and triglycerides: OR, -0.27; 95\% CI, -0.61 to
                 0.08); results were similar in patients with low-normal to
                 normal testosterone levels. The OR between testosterone use
                 and any cardiovascular event pooled across trials that
                 reported these events (n = 6) was 1.82 (95\% CI, 0.78 to
                 4.23). Several trials failed to report data on measured
                 outcomes. For reasons we could not explain statistically, the
                 results were inconsistent across trials. CONCLUSION: Currently
                 available evidence weakly supports the inference that
                 testosterone use in men is not associated with important
                 cardiovascular effects. Patients and clinicians need large
                 randomized trials of men at risk for cardiovascular disease to
                 better inform the safety of long-term testosterone use.",

                 age-testosterone correlations ranged from -0.68 to +0.68. In
                 cross-study comparisons, certain research design

                 various sample characteristics (e.g. volunteers vs patients as
                 subjects) were related to both mean testosterone level and the
                 slope of the age-testosterone relation. For example, for
                 subgroups of subjects that did not exclude ill men, the mean
                 testosterone levels were low, and did not decline with age.

                 had higher overall testosterone levels and showed a decline of

                 clinical trials to determine the risks of adverse events
                 associated with testosterone replacement in older men.
                 METHODS: The MEDLINE database was searched from 1966 to April
                 2004, using testosterone as the indexing term; limits included
                 human, male, > or =45 years old, and randomized controlled
                 trial. Of the 417 studies thus identified, 19 met the
                 inclusion criteria: testosterone replacement for at least 90
                 days, men > or =45 years old with low or low-normal
                 testosterone level, randomized controlled trial, and medically
                 stable men. Odds ratios (ORs) were pooled using a random
                 effects model, assuming heterogeneous results across studies,
                 and were weighted for sample size. RESULTS: In the 19 studies
                 that met eligibility criteria, 651 men were treated with
                 testosterone and 433 with placebo. The combined rate of all
                 prostate events was significantly greater in
                 testosterone-treated men than in placebo-treated men (OR =
                 1.78, 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-2.95). Rates of
                 prostate cancer, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >4 ng/ml, and
                 prostate biopsies were numerically higher in the testosterone
                 group than in the placebo group, although differences between
                 the groups were not individually statistically significant.
                 Testosterone-treated men were nearly four times as likely to
                 have hematocrit >50\% as placebo-treated men (OR = 3.69, 95\%
                 CI, 1.82-7.51). The frequency of cardiovascular events, sleep
                 apnea or death was not significantly different between the two
                 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Testosterone replacement in older men was
                 associated with a significantly higher risk of detection of
                 prostate events and of hematocrit >50\% than was placebo;
                 hematocrit increase was the most frequent adverse event
                 associated with testosterone replacement. These data reaffirm
                 the need to monitor hematocrit, PSA, and digital examination

              obesity also had a higher mortality risk than those with similar
              BMI but no central obesity (HR, 1.48 [CI, 1.35 to 1.62]) and
              those who were obese according to BMI only (HR, 1.32 [CI, 1.15 to
              1.51]). Expected survival estimates were consistently lower for
              those with central obesity when age and BMI were controlled for.
              Limitations: Body fat distribution was assessed based on
              anthropometric indicators alone. Information on comorbidities was
              collected by self-report. Conclusion: Normal-weight central
              obesity defined by WHR is associated with higher mortality than
              BMI-defined obesity, particularly in the absence of central fat
              distribution. Primary Funding Source: National Institutes of

  abstract      = "The Sun's gradual brightening will seriously compromise the
                   Earth's biosphere within ~ 1E9 years. If Earth's orbit
                   migrates outward, however, the biosphere could remain intact
                   over the entire main-sequence lifetime of the Sun. In this
                   paper, we explore the feasibility of engineering such a
                   migration over a long time period. The basic mechanism uses
                   gravitational assists to (in effect) transfer orbital energy
                   from Jupiter to the Earth, and thereby enlarges the orbital
                   radius of Earth. This transfer is accomplished by a suitable
                   intermediate body, either a Kuiper Belt object or a main
                   belt asteroid. The object first encounters Earth during an
                   inward pass on its initial highly elliptical orbit of large
                   (~ 300 AU) semimajor axis. The encounter transfers energy
                   from the object to the Earth in standard gravity-assist
                   fashion by passing close to the leading limb of the planet.
                   The resulting outbound trajectory of the object must cross
                   the orbit of Jupiter; with proper timing, the outbound
                   object encounters Jupiter and picks up the energy it lost to
                   Earth. With small corrections to the trajectory, or
                   additional planetary encounters (e.g., with Saturn), the
                   object can repeat this process over many encounters. To
                   maintain its present flux of solar energy, the Earth must
                   experience roughly one encounter every 6000 years (for an
                   object mass of 1E22 g). We develop the details of this
                   scheme and discuss its ramifications.",

               logically with the frequency of eight types of anger
               consequences, and there was evidence of distinct relationships
               between anger expression and anger consequences; e.g. Physical

  abstract    = "IMPORTANCE: Cannabis and cannabinoid drugs are widely used to
                 treat disease or alleviate symptoms, but their efficacy for
                 specific indications is not clear. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a
                 systematic review of the benefits and adverse events (AEs) of
                 cannabinoids. DATA SOURCES: Twenty-eight databases from
                 inception to April 2015. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical
                 trials of cannabinoids for the following indications: nausea
                 and vomiting due to chemotherapy, appetite stimulation in
                 HIV/AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity due to multiple sclerosis
                 or paraplegia, depression, anxiety disorder, sleep disorder,
                 psychosis, glaucoma, or Tourette syndrome. DATA EXTRACTION AND
                 SYNTHESIS: Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk
                 of bias tool. All review stages were conducted independently
                 by 2 reviewers. Where possible, data were pooled using
                 random-effects meta-analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:
                 Patient-relevant/disease-specific outcomes, activities of
                 daily living, quality of life, global impression of change,
                 and AEs. RESULTS: A total of 79 trials (6462 participants)
                 were included; 4 were judged at low risk of bias. Most trials
                 showed improvement in symptoms associated with cannabinoids
                 but these associations did not reach statistical significance
                 in all trials. Compared with placebo, cannabinoids were
                 associated with a greater average number of patients showing a
                 complete nausea and vomiting response (47\% vs 20\%; odds
                 ratio [OR], 3.82 [95\% CI, 1.55-9.42]; 3 trials), reduction in
                 pain (37\% vs 31\%; OR, 1.41 [95\% CI, 0.99-2.00]; 8 trials),
                 a greater average reduction in numerical rating scale pain
                 assessment (on a 0-10-point scale; weighted mean difference
                 [WMD], -0.46 [95\% CI, -0.80 to -0.11]; 6 trials), and average
                 reduction in the Ashworth spasticity scale (WMD, -0.36 [95\%
                 CI, -0.69 to -0.05]; 7 trials). There was an increased risk of
                 short-term AEs with cannabinoids, including serious AEs.
                 Common AEs included dizziness, dry mouth, nausea, fatigue,
                 somnolence, euphoria, vomiting, disorientation, drowsiness,
                 confusion, loss of balance, and hallucination. CONCLUSIONS AND
                 RELEVANCE: There was moderate-quality evidence to support the
                 use of cannabinoids for the treatment of chronic pain and
                 spasticity. There was low-quality evidence suggesting that
                 cannabinoids were associated with improvements in nausea and
                 vomiting due to chemotherapy, weight gain in HIV infection,
                 sleep disorders, and Tourette syndrome. Cannabinoids were
                 associated with an increased risk of short-term AEs.",

               early in ontogeny [ 1 ] and are shaped by interactions between
               genes and culture [ 2, 3 ]. Over the course of middle childhood,
               sharing approaches equality in distribution [ 4 ]. Since 5.8
               billion humans, representing 84\% of the worldwide population,
               identify as religious [ 5 ], religion is arguably one prevalent
               facet of culture that influences the development and expression
               of prosociality. While it is generally accepted that religion
               contours people’s moral judgments and prosocial behavior, the
               relation between religiosity and morality is a contentious one.
               Here, we assessed altruism and third-party evaluation of
               scenarios depicting interpersonal harm in 1,170 children aged
               between 5 and 12 years in six countries (Canada, China, Jordan,
               Turkey, USA, and South Africa), the religiousness of their
               household, and parent-reported child empathy and sensitivity to
               justice. Across all countries, parents in religious households
               reported that their children expressed more empathy and
               sensitivity for justice in everyday life than non-religious
               parents. However, religiousness was inversely predictive of
               children’s altruism and positively correlated with their
               punitive tendencies. Together these results reveal the
               similarity across countries in how religion negatively
               influences children’s altruism, challenging the view that
               religiosity facilitates prosocial behavior.",

              configuration of the giant planets. Statistically, some of the
              most successful dynamical evolution simulations have initially
              included a hypothetical fifth giant planet, of ice giant (IG)
              mass, which gets ejected by a gas giant during the early solar
              system’s proposed instability phase. We investigate the
              likelihood of an IG ejection (IGE) event by either Jupiter or
              Saturn through constraints imposed by the current orbits of their
              wide-separation regular satellites Callisto and Iapetus,
              respectively. We show that planetary encounters that are
              sufficient to eject an IG often provide excessive perturbations
              to the orbits of Callisto and Iapetus, making it difficult to
              reconcile a planet ejection event with the current orbit of
              either satellite. Quantitatively, we compute the likelihood of
              reconciling a regular Jovian satellite orbit with the current
              orbit of Callisto following an IGE by Jupiter of ∼42\%, and
              conclude that such a large likelihood supports the hypothesis of
              a fifth giant planet’s existence. A similar calculation for
              Iapetus reveals that it is much more difficult for Saturn to have
              ejected an IG and reconciled a Kronian satellite orbit with that
              of Iapetus (likelihood ∼1\%), although uncertainties regarding
              the formation of Iapetus, with its unusual orbit, complicates the
              interpretation of this result.",

              of magma buoyancy as an eruption trigger",
  author   = "Gregg, Patricia M and Grosfils, Eric B and de Silva, Shanaka L",
  abstract = "Abstract Recent analytical investigations have suggested that
              magma buoyancy is critical for triggering catastrophic caldera
              forming eruptions. Through detailed assessment of these
              approaches, we illustrate how analytical models have been
              misapplied for investigating buoyancy and are, therefore,
              incorrect and inconclusive. Nevertheless, the hypothesis that
              buoyancy is the critical trigger for larger eruptions warrants
              further investigation. As such, we utilize viscoelastic finite
              element models that incorporate buoyancy to test overpressure
              evolution and mechanical failure in the roof due to the
              coalescence of large buoyant magma bodies for two model cases. In
              the first case, we mimic empirical approaches and include
              buoyancy as an explicit boundary condition. In the second set of
              models, buoyancy is calculated implicitly due to the density
              contrast between the magma in the reservoir and the host rock.
              Results from these numerical experiments indicate that buoyancy
              promotes only minimal overpressurization of large silicic magma
              reservoirs ( 100 km3) they surpass a rheological threshold where
              their subsequent evolution is controlled by host rock mechanics.
              Consequently, this results in a thermomechanical division between
              small systems that are triggered ``internally'' by magmatic
              processes and large systems that are triggered ``externally'' by
              faulting related to roof uplift or tectonism. Finally, critical
              assessment of recent analytical approaches illustrates that care
              must be used when applying previously derived analytical
              solutions to ensure that assumptions used in the original
              formulation are not violated during application to new geologic
              problems.",

                 proposal dovetails with currently prevailing cognitive theory
                 regarding the nature of conscious versus unconscious
                 processes, which holds that the latter are simple and very
                 brief, whereas consciousness is ostensibly required for more
                 durable, complex cognitive processing. Using a P3b oddball

                   well correlated with corresponding emission at 100 GHz. The
                   median residual 100 to 143 GHz intensity ratio is consistent
                   with Galactic synchrotron emission with a
                   I$_\{\textbackslash{}nu\}\textbackslash{}propto\textbackslash{}nu^\{-0.69\}$

                   regions which show anomalously strong 143 GHz emission but
                   no correspondingly strong emission at either 100 or 217 GHz.
                   The signal to noise of this 143 GHz residual emission is at

                   probability that noise fluctuations may cause foregrounds to
                   fall within 3$\textbackslash{}sigma$ of the excess, it could

                 abiotic assembly of such an overall system, however, places
                 great demands on hypothetical prebiotic chemistry. The
                 perceived differences and incompatibilities between these
                 subsystems have led to the widely held assumption that one or

              simulation. The first part of this paper is devoted to broadening
              the scope of the argument: even if computers cannot sustain
              consciousness (as many dualists and materialists believe), there
              may still be a strong likelihood that we are living simulated
              lives. The implications of this result are the focus of the
              second part of the paper. The topics discussed include: the
              Doomsday argument, scepticism, the different modes of virtual
              life, transcendental idealism, the Problem of Evil, and

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: The indoor built environment plays a critical role
                 in our overall well-being, both due to the amount of time we
                 spend indoors (~90\%) and the ability of buildings to
                 positively or negatively influence our health. The advent of
                 sustainable design or green building strategies reinvigorated
                 questions regarding the specific factors in buildings that
                 lead to optimized conditions for health and productivity.
                 OBJECTIVE: To simulate indoor environmental quality (IEQ)
                 conditions in ``Green'' and ``Conventional'' buildings and
                 evaluate the impacts on an objective measure of human
                 performance - higher order cognitive function. METHODS:
                 Twenty-four (24) participants spent 6 full work days (9 a.m. -
                 5 p.m.) in an environmentally controlled office space, blinded
                 to test conditions. On different days, they were exposed to
                 IEQ conditions representative of Conventional (high volatile
                 organic compound (VOC) concentration) and Green (low VOC
                 concentration) office buildings in the U.S. Additional
                 conditions simulated a Green building with a high outdoor air
                 ventilation rate (labeled Green+) and artificially elevated
                 carbon dioxide (CO2) levels independent of ventilation.
                 RESULTS: On average, cognitive scores were 61\% higher on the
                 Green building day and 101\% higher on the two Green+ building
                 days than on the Conventional building day (p<0.0001). VOCs
                 and CO2 were independently associated with cognitive scores.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive function scores were significantly
                 better in Green+ building conditions compared to the
                 Conventional building conditions for all nine functional
                 domains. These findings have wide ranging implications because
                 this study was designed to reflect conditions that are
                 commonly encountered every day in many indoor environments.",

  abstract    = "Devastating floods due to Atlantic hurricanes are relatively
                 rare events. However, the frequency of the most intense storms
                 is likely to increase with rises in sea surface temperatures.
                 Geoengineering by stratospheric sulfate aerosol injection
                 cools the tropics relative to the polar regions, including the
                 hurricane Main Development Region in the Atlantic, suggesting
                 that geoengineering may mitigate hurricanes. We examine this
                 hypothesis using eight earth system model simulations of
                 climate under the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project
                 (GeoMIP) G3 and G4 schemes that use stratospheric aerosols to
                 reduce the radiative forcing under the Representative
                 Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 scenario. Global mean
                 temperature increases are greatly ameliorated by
                 geoengineering, and tropical temperature increases are at most
                 half of those temperature increases in the RCP4.5. However,
                 sulfate injection would have to double (to nearly 10 teragrams
                 of SO2 per year) between 2020 and 2070 to balance the RCP4.5,
                 approximately the equivalent of a 1991 Pinatubo eruption every
                 2 y, with consequent implications for stratospheric ozone. We
                 project changes in storm frequencies using a
                 temperature-dependent generalized extreme value statistical
                 model calibrated by historical storm surges and observed
                 temperatures since 1923. The number of storm surge events as
                 big as the one caused by the 2005 Katrina hurricane are
                 reduced by about 50\% compared with no geoengineering, but
                 this reduction is only marginally statistically significant.
                 Nevertheless, when sea level rise differences in 2070 between
                 the RCP4.5 and geoengineering are factored into coastal flood
                 risk, we find that expected flood levels are reduced by about
                 40 cm for 5-y events and about halved for 50-y surges.",

                 solve new problems independently of previously acquired
                 knowledge. Gf is critical for a wide variety of cognitive
                 tasks, and it is considered one of the most important factors
                 in learning. Moreover, Gf is closely related to professional
                 and educational success, especially in complex and demanding
                 environments. Although performance on tests of Gf can be
                 improved through direct practice on the tests themselves,
                 there is no evidence that training on any other regimen yields
                 increased Gf in adults. Furthermore, there is a long history
                 of research into cognitive training showing that, although
                 performance on trained tasks can increase dramatically,
                 transfer of this learning to other tasks remains poor. Here,
                 we present evidence for transfer from training on a demanding
                 working memory task to measures of Gf. This transfer results
                 even though the trained task is entirely different from the
                 intelligence test itself. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
                 extent of gain in intelligence critically depends on the
                 amount of training: the more training, the more improvement in
                 Gf. That is, the training effect is dosage-dependent. Thus, in
                 contrast to many previous studies, we conclude that it is
                 possible to improve Gf without practicing the testing tasks

                 systematic investigations of what types of cognitive damage

  abstract = "Abstract The Fermi paradox is the discrepancy between the strong
              likelihood of alien intelligent life emerging (under a wide
              variety of assumptions) and the absence of any visible evidence
              for such emergence. In this paper, we extend the Fermi paradox to
              not only life in this galaxy, but to other galaxies as well. We
              do this by demonstrating that travelling between galaxies --
              indeed even launching a colonisation project for the entire
              reachable universe -- is a relatively simple task for a
              star-spanning civilisation, requiring modest amounts of energy
              and resources. We start by demonstrating that humanity itself
              could likely accomplish such a colonisation project in the
              foreseeable future, should we want to. Given certain
              technological assumptions, such as improved automation, the task
              of constructing Dyson spheres, designing replicating probes, and
              launching them at distant galaxies, become quite feasible. We
              extensively analyse the dynamics of such a project, including
              issues of deceleration and collision with particles in space.
              Using similar methods, there are millions of galaxies that could
              have reached us by now. This results in a considerable sharpening

                 more than half (56\% and 58\%) rejected the arguments that

                 likely to reject their own arguments for invalid than for
                 valid answers. This demonstrates that people are more critical
                 of other people's arguments than of their own, without being
                 overly critical: They are better able to tell valid from

  abstract      = "The Class A stellar engine (also known as a Shkadov
                   thruster) is a spherical arc mirror, designed to use the
                   impulse from a star's radiation pressure to generate a
                   thrust force, perturbing the star's motion. If this mirror
                   obstructs part of the stellar disc during the transit of an
                   exoplanet, then this may be detected by studying the shape
                   of the transit light curve, presenting another potential
                   means by which the action of extraterrestrial intelligence
                   (ETI) can be discerned. We model the light curves produced
                   by exoplanets transiting a star which possesses a Shkadov
                   thruster, and show how the parameters of the planet and the
                   properties of the thruster can be disentangled. provided
                   that radial velocity follow-up measurements are possible,
                   and that other obscuring phenomena typical to exoplanet
                   transit curves (such as the presence of starspots or
                   intrinsic stellar noise) do not dominate. These difficulties
                   aside, we estimate the a priori probability of detecting a
                   Shkadov thruster during an exoplanet transit, which even
                   given optimistic assumptions remains stubbornly low. Despite

                   velocity follow-up are on the horizon, so we argue that this
                   remains a useful serendipitous SETI technique. At worst,
                   this technique will place an upper limit on the number of
                   Class A stellar engines in the Solar neighbourhood; at best,

                   We discuss some philosophical difficulties of SETI, and how
                   communication SETI circumvents them. We review ``Dysonian
                   SETI'', the search for artifacts of alien civilizations, and
                   find that it is highly complementary to traditional
                   communication SETI; the two together might succeed where
                   either one, alone, has not. We discuss the argument of Hart
                   (1975) that spacefaring life in the Milky Way should be
                   either galaxy-spanning or non-existent, and examine a
                   portion of his argument that we dub the ``monocultural
                   fallacy''. We discuss some rebuttals to Hart that invoke
                   sustainability and predict long Galaxy colonization
                   timescales. We find that the maximum Galaxy colonization
                   timescale is actually much shorter than previous work has
                   found ($< 10^9$ yr), and that many ``sustainability''
                   counter-arguments to Hart's thesis suffer from the
                   monocultural fallacy. We extend Hart's argument to alien
                   energy supplies, and argue that detectably large energy
                   supplies can plausibly be expected to exist because life has
                   potential for exponential growth until checked by resource
                   or other limitations, and intelligence implies the ability
                   to overcome such limitations. As such, if Hart's thesis is
                   correct then searches for large alien civilizations in other
                   galaxies may be fruitful; if it is incorrect, then searches
                   for civilizations within the Milky Way are more likely to
                   succeed than Hart argued. We review some past Dysonian SETI

  author   = "Randle, Melanie and Eckersley, Richard",
  abstract = "Abstract There is growing scientific evidence that humanity faces
              a number of threats that jeopardize its future. Public
              perceptions of these threats, both their risks and reactions to
              them, are important in determining how humanity confronts and
              addresses the threats. This study investigated the perceived
              probability of threats to humanity and different responses to
              them (nihilism, fundamentalism and activism), in four Western
              nations: the US, UK, Canada and Australia. Overall, a majority
              (54\%) rated the risk of our way of life ending within the next
              100 years at 50\% or greater, and a quarter (24\%) rated the risk
              of humans being wiped out at 50\% or greater. The responses were
              relatively uniform across countries, age groups, gender and
              education level, although statistically significant differences
              exist. Almost 80\% agreed ``we need to transform our worldview
              and way of life if we are to create a better future for the
              world'' (activism). About a half agreed that ``the world’s future
              looks grim so we have to focus on looking after ourselves and
              those we love'' (nihilism), and over a third that ``we are facing
              a final conflict between good and evil in the world''
              (fundamentalism). The findings offer insight into the willingness
              of humanity to respond to the challenges identified by scientists

  abstract = "Abstract A variety of global catastrophes threaten the survival
              of human civilization. For many of these catastrophes, isolated
              refuges could keep some people alive and enable them to rebuild
              civilization in the post-catastrophe world. This paper examines
              the potential importance of refuges and what it would take to
              make them succeed. The successful refuge will have a variety of
              qualities, including isolation from catastrophes and
              self-sufficiency. These qualities can be achieved through a
              variety of specific design features. We introduce the concept of
              surface-independence as the gold standard for refuge excellence:
              refuges isolated from Earth's surface will offer maximum
              protection against both the catastrophe itself and potentially
              harmful post-catastrophe populations. However,
              surface-independence introduces significant design challenges. We
              present several challenges and evaluate possible solutions.
              Self-sufficiency in food provision can be greatly enhanced via
              chemical food synthesis. The rejection of waste heat from
              subterranean refuges can be enhanced via building piping networks
              and locating refuges near running groundwater or in ice. The high
              cost of extraterrestrial refuges can be offset by integrating
              refuges into space missions with scientific, political, or
              commercial goals. Overall, refuges show much promise for
              protecting civilization against global catastrophes and thus
              warrant serious consideration.",

              humanity: Practical significance and alternatives",
  author   = "Baum, Seth D",
  abstract = "Abstract Sufficiently large catastrophes can affect human
              civilization into the far future: thousands, millions, or
              billions of years from now, or even longer. The far future
              argument says that people should confront catastrophic threats to
              humanity in order to improve the far future trajectory of human
              civilization. However, many people are not motivated to help the
              far future. They are concerned only with the near future, or only
              with themselves and their communities. This paper assesses the
              extent to which practical actions to confront catastrophic
              threats require support for the far future argument and proposes
              two alternative means of motivating actions. First, many
              catastrophes could occur in the near future; actions to confront
              them have near-future benefits. Second, many actions have
              co-benefits unrelated to catastrophes, and can be mainstreamed
              into established activities. Most actions, covering most of the
              total threat, can be motivated with one or both of these
              alternatives. However, some catastrophe-confronting actions can
              only be justified with reference to the far future. Attention to
              the far future can also sometimes inspire additional action.
              Confronting catastrophic threats best succeeds when it considers
              the specific practical actions to confront the threats and the
              various motivations people may have to take these actions.",

  abstract = "Abstract The climate of Earth is susceptible to catastrophes that
              could threaten the longevity of human civilization.
              Geoengineering to reduce incoming solar radiation has been
              suggested as a way to mediate the warming effects of contemporary
              climate change, but a geoengineering program for thousands of
              years could also be used to enlarge the size of the polar ice
              caps and create a permanently cooler climate. Such a large ice
              cap state would make Earth less susceptible to climate threats
              and could allow human civilization to survive further into the
              future than otherwise possible. Intentionally extending Earth’s
              glacial coverage will require uninterrupted commitment to this
              program for millenia but would ultimately reach a cooler
              equilibrium state where geoengineering is no longer needed.
              Whether or not this program is ever attempted, this concept

              effects including surface temperature declines and increased
              ultraviolet radiation. The temperature decline and the full set
              of environmental effects are known as nuclear winter. This paper
              surveys the range of actions that can confront the threat of
              nuclear winter, both now and in the future. Nuclear winter can be
              confronted by reducing the probability of nuclear war, reducing
              the environmental severity of nuclear winter, increasing
              humanity's resilience to nuclear winter, and through indirect
              interventions that enhance these other interventions. While some

  abstract = "Abstract Some global catastrophes (such as nuclear wars,
              pandemics, or an asteroid collision) might destroy civilization.
              Some propose building well-stocked shelters constantly staffed
              with people trained to rebuild civilization in such cases. These
              ``refuges'' would have an unimpressive expected cost per life
              saved, but could conceivably have an impressive expected cost per
              future generation allowed to exist. From some ethical
              perspectives that highly value future generations, building
              refuges may therefore seem like a promising idea. However,
              several factors significantly dilute the potential impact of
              refuges, even if the proposed catastrophes occur.
              Government/private disaster shelters, people working on
              submarines, and isolated peoples who prefer to be left alone
              serve these purposes to some extent already. Many proposed
              catastrophes do too much/too little damage for refuges to help,
              affect the environment in ways that make refuges largely
              irrelevant, or otherwise give relatively limited advantages to
              the people in refuges. In global food crises or social collapse
              scenarios, refuges would add little to aggregate stocks of
              population, resources, food, and relevant skills; but they may
              add something unique in terms of isolation and coordination.

              are widely used in the form of digital certificates, message

              compromised by quantum computing, governments and other
              organizations would be able to eavesdrop on private citizens with
              relative ease. This has the potential to cause a slew of rights
              violations and atrocities leading to catastrophe. With
              compromised digital certificates 3rd parties could masquerade as

                   for validation, so prioritizing planets for habitability
                   from transit data has become an important aspect of the
                   search for life in the universe. We propose a method to
                   compare transiting planets for their potential to support
                   life based on transit data, stellar properties and
                   previously reported limits on planetary emitted flux. For a
                   planet in radiative equilibrium, the emitted flux increases
                   with eccentricity, but decreases with albedo. As these
                   parameters are often unconstrained, there is an
                   ``eccentricity-albedo degeneracy'' for the habitability of
                   transiting exoplanets. Our method mitigates this degeneracy,
                   includes a penalty for large-radius planets, uses
                   terrestrial mass-radius relationships, and, when available,
                   constraints on eccentricity to compute a number we call the
                   ``habitability index for transiting exoplanets'' that
                   represents the relative probability that an exoplanet could
                   support liquid surface water. We calculate it for Kepler
                   Objects of Interest and find that planets that receive
                   between 60-90\% of the Earth's incident radiation, assuming
                   circular orbits, are most likely to be habitable. Finally,
                   we make predictions for the upcoming TESS and JWST missions.",

                   from natural language processing pipelines. End-to-end

                 demonstrate the potential processes by which living cells

                   Karadashev Type III civilisations via the compilation of a
                   sample of sources with extreme mid-IR emission and colours.
                   In this scenario, the mid-IR emission is then primarily
                   associated with waste heat energy by-products. I apply the
                   Mid-IR radio correlation to this $\textbackslash{}hat\{G\}$
                   sample (Griffith et al. 2015). I demonstrate that the mid-IR
                   and radio luminosities are correlated for the sample with
                   $q_\{22\}=1.35\textbackslash{}pm0.42 $. By comparison, the
                   First Look Survey (FLS) has
                   $q_\{22\}=0.87\textbackslash{}pm0.27$. The fact that the
                   G-HAT sample largely follows the Mid-IR radio correlation,
                   strongly suggests the vast majority of these sources are
                   associated with galaxies in which natural astrophysical
                   processes are dominant. This simple application of the
                   mid-IR radio correlation can substantially reduce the number
                   of false positives in the $\textbackslash{}hat\{G\}$
                   catalogue, since galaxies occupied by advanced Kardashev
                   Type III civilisations would be expected to exhibit very
                   high values of $q$. Indeed I identify 9 outliers in the
                   sample with $q_\{22\} > 2$ of which at least 3 have
                   properties that are relatively well explained via standard
                   astrophysical interpretations e.g. dust emission associated
                   with nascent star formation and/or nuclear activity from a
                   heavily obscured AGN. I also note that the comparison of
                   resolved Mid-IR and radio images of galaxies on sub-galactic
                   (kpc) scales can also be useful in identifying and
                   recognising artificial mid-IR emission from less advanced
                   intermediate Type II/III civilisations. Nevertheless, from
                   the bulk properties of the $\textbackslash{}hat\{G\}$

                 concerned with identifying those regions of the Galaxy that
                 may favor the emergence of complex life. A planet is deemed
                 habitable if it meets a set of assumed criteria for supporting
                 the emergence of such complex life. In this work, we extend
                 the assessment of habitability to consider the potential for
                 life to further evolve to the point of intelligence-termed the
                 propensity for the emergence of intelligent life, $\varphi$I.
                 We assume $\varphi$I is strongly influenced by the time
                 durations available for evolutionary processes to proceed
                 undisturbed by the sterilizing effects of nearby supernovae.
                 The times between supernova events provide windows of
                 opportunity for the evolution of intelligence. We developed a
                 model that allows us to analyze these window times to generate
                 a metric for $\varphi$I, and we examine here the spatial and
                 temporal variation of this metric. Even under the assumption
                 that long time durations are required between sterilizations
                 to allow for the emergence of intelligence, our model suggests
                 that the inner Galaxy provides the greatest number of
                 opportunities for intelligence to arise. This is due to the
                 substantially higher number density of habitable planets in
                 this region, which outweighs the effects of a higher supernova
                 rate in the region. Our model also shows that $\varphi$I is
                 increasing with time. Intelligent life emerged at
                 approximately the present time at Earth's galactocentric
                 radius, but a similar level of evolutionary opportunity was
                 available in the inner Galaxy more than 2 Gyr ago. Our
                 findings suggest that the inner Galaxy should logically be a
                 prime target region for searches for extraterrestrial
                 intelligence and that any civilizations that may have emerged
                 there are potentially much older than our own. Key Words:

              article analyzes the harm and benefits of deliberate and
              unintentional transmissions relevant to Earth and humanity.
              Comparing the magnitude of deliberate radio broadcasts intended
              for messaging to extraterrestrial intelligence (METI) with the
              background radio spectrum of Earth, we find that METI attempts to
              date have much lower detectability than emissions from current
              radio communication technologies on Earth. METI broadcasts are
              usually transient and several orders of magnitude less powerful
              than other terrestrial sources, such as astronomical and military
              radars, which provide the strongest detectable signals. The
              benefits of radio communication on Earth most probably outweigh
              the potential harm of detection by extraterrestrial watchers;
              however, the uncertainty regarding the outcome of contact with
              extraterrestrial beings creates difficulty in assessing whether

                   (``cosmological constant'') on our formulation of anthropic
                   conjectures, particularly the so-called Final Anthropic
                   Principle is investigated. It is shown that non-zero vacuum
                   energy implies the onset of a quasi-exponential expansion of
                   our causally connected domain (``the universe'') at some
                   point in the future, a stage similar to the inflationary
                   expansion at the very beginning of time. The transition to
                   this future inflationary phase of cosmological expansion
                   will preclude indefinite survival of intelligent species in
                   our domain, because of the rapid shrinking of particle
                   horizons and subsequent depletion of energy necessary for
                   information processes within the horizon of any observer.
                   Therefore, to satisfy the Final Anthropic Hypothesis
                   (reformulated to apply to the entire ensemble of universes),
                   it is necessary to show that (i) chaotic inflation of Linde
                   (or some similar model) provides a satisfactory description
                   of reality, (ii) migration between causally connected
                   domains within the multiverse is physically permitted, and
                   (iii) the time interval left to the onset of the future
                   inflationary phase is sufficient for development of the
                   technology necessary for such inter-domain travel. These
                   stringent requirements diminish the probability of the Final
                   Anthropic Hypothesis being true.",

                 called negligible senescence, i.e. they do not show signs of
                 functional decline or any increase of mortality with age.
                 Recent studies in naked mole rat and long-lived sea urchins
                 showed that these species do not alter their gene-expression
                 profiles with age as much as other organisms do. This is
                 consistent with exceptional endurance of naked mole rat
                 tissues to various genotoxic stresses. We conjectured,
                 therefore, that the lifelong transcriptional stability of an
                 organism may be a key determinant of longevity. We analyzed
                 the stability of a simple genetic-network model and found that
                 under most common circumstances, such a gene network is
                 inherently unstable. Over a time it undergoes an exponential
                 accumulation of gene-regulation deviations leading to death.
                 However, should the repair systems be sufficiently effective,
                 the gene network can stabilize so that gene damage remains
                 constrained along with mortality of the organism. We
                 investigate the relationship between stress-resistance and
                 aging and suggest that the unstable regime may provide a
                 mathematical basis for the Gompertz ``law'' of aging in many
                 species. At the same time, this model accounts for the
                 apparently age-independent mortality observed in some

                   life which arose via spreading will exhibit more clustering

                   statistical models of panspermia to illustrate observable
                   consequences of these excess correlations. Future searches
                   for biosignatures in the atmospheres of exoplanets could
                   test these predictions: a smoking gun signature of
                   panspermia would be the detection of large regions in the
                   Milky Way where life saturates its environment interspersed
                   with voids where life is very uncommon. In a favorable

              otherwise unavailable. The proliferation of publicly available

              Common approaches for linking names and identity groups perform
              poorly when estimating group proportions. I have developed a new
              method for estimating racial or ethnic composition from names
              which requires no classification of individual names. This method
              provides more accurate estimates than the standard approach and

                   method for training agents to perform a wide variety of
                   behaviours. RL as used in computer science has striking
                   parallels to reward and punishment learning in animal and
                   human brains. I argue that present-day artificial RL agents
                   have a very small but nonzero degree of ethical importance.
                   This is particularly plausible for views according to which
                   sentience comes in degrees based on the abilities and
                   complexities of minds, but even binary views on

                   programs having morally relevant experiences. While RL
                   programs are not a top ethical priority today, they may
                   become more significant in the coming decades as RL is
                   increasingly applied to industry, robotics, video games, and

  abstract = "The notion of ‘wireheading’, or direct reward centre stimulation
              of the brain, is a well-known concept in neuroscience. In this
              paper, we examine the corresponding issue of reward (utility)
              function integrity in artificially intelligent machines. We
              survey the relevant literature and propose a number of potential
              solutions to ensure the integrity of our artificial assistants.
              Overall, we conclude that wireheading in rational self-improving
              optimisers above a certain capacity remains an unsolved problem
              despite opinion of many that such machines will choose not to
              wirehead. A relevant issue of literalness in goal setting also
              remains largely unsolved and we suggest that the development of a
              non-ambiguous knowledge transfer language might be a step in the
              right direction.",

  abstract    = "After growing up together, and mostly growing apart in the
                 second half of the 20th century, the fields of artificial
                 intelligence (AI), cognitive science, and neuroscience are
                 reconverging on a shared view of the computational foundations
                 of intelligence that promotes valuable cross-disciplinary
                 exchanges on questions, methods, and results. We chart
                 advances over the past several decades that address challenges
                 of perception and action under uncertainty through the lens of
                 computation. Advances include the development of
                 representations and inferential procedures for large-scale
                 probabilistic inference and machinery for enabling reflection
                 and decisions about tradeoffs in effort, precision, and
                 timeliness of computations. These tools are deployed toward
                 the goal of computational rationality: identifying decisions
                 with highest expected utility, while taking into consideration
                 the costs of computation in complex real-world problems in
                 which most relevant calculations can only be approximated. We

              However, although he makes frequent references in his writings to
              this approach, his main explorations and insights depend upon and
              require acknowledgment of its limitations. One of his principal
              concerns was how a country could engage in successful deterrence.
              If the behavioral assumptions that commonly underpin game theory
              are taken seriously and applied consistently, however, nuclear
              adversaries are almost certain to engage in devastating conflict,
              as John von Neumann forcefully asserted. The history of the last
              half century falsified von Neumann’s prediction, and the ``event
              that didn’t occur'' formed the subject of Schelling’s Nobel

  abstract    = "A growing body of research has focused on so-called
                 'utilitarian' judgments in moral dilemmas in which
                 participants have to choose whether to sacrifice one person in
                 order to save the lives of a greater number. However, the
                 relation between such 'utilitarian' judgments and genuine
                 utilitarian impartial concern for the greater good remains
                 unclear. Across four studies, we investigated the relationship
                 between 'utilitarian' judgment in such sacrificial dilemmas
                 and a range of traits, attitudes, judgments and behaviors that
                 either reflect or reject an impartial concern for the greater
                 good of all. In Study 1, we found that rates of 'utilitarian'
                 judgment were associated with a broadly immoral outlook
                 concerning clear ethical transgressions in a business context,
                 as well as with sub-clinical psychopathy. In Study 2, we found
                 that 'utilitarian' judgment was associated with greater
                 endorsement of rational egoism, less donation of money to a
                 charity, and less identification with the whole of humanity, a
                 core feature of classical utilitarianism. In Studies 3 and 4,
                 we found no association between 'utilitarian' judgments in
                 sacrificial dilemmas and characteristic utilitarian judgments
                 relating to assistance to distant people in need,
                 self-sacrifice and impartiality, even when the utilitarian
                 justification for these judgments was made explicit and
                 unequivocal. This lack of association remained even when we
                 controlled for the antisocial element in 'utilitarian'
                 judgment. Taken together, these results suggest that there is
                 very little relation between sacrificial judgments in the
                 hypothetical dilemmas that dominate current research, and a
                 genuine utilitarian approach to ethics.",

                   reality created by information processing, and relates this
                   strange idea to the findings of modern physics about the
                   physical world. The virtual reality concept is familiar to
                   us from online worlds, but our world as a virtual reality is
                   usually a subject for science fiction rather than science.
                   Yet logically the world could be an information simulation
                   running on a multi-dimensional space-time screen. Indeed, if
                   the essence of the universe is information, matter, charge,
                   energy and movement could be aspects of information, and the
                   many conservation laws could be a single law of information
                   conservation. If the universe were a virtual reality, its
                   creation at the big bang would no longer be paradoxical, as
                   every virtual system must be booted up. It is suggested that
                   whether the world is an objective reality or a virtual
                   reality is a matter for science to resolve. Modern
                   information science can suggest how core physical properties
                   like space, time, light, matter and movement could derive
                   from information processing. Such an approach could
                   reconcile relativity and quantum theories, with the former
                   being how information processing creates space-time, and the
                   latter how it creates energy and matter.",

                 experimentally by confining ions in a ring-shaped trapping
                 potential with a static magnetic field. The ions spontaneously
                 form a spatial ring crystal due to Coulomb repulsion. This ion
                 crystal can rotate persistently at the lowest quantum energy
                 state in magnetic fields with fractional fluxes. The

              consideration, one can estimate the rate of missing data across
              sources and come up with an estimate of the true number of
              events. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, we compare
              Associated Press and Agence France Press reports on conflict
              events, as contained in the Social Conflict in Africa Database.
              We show that these sources capture approximately 76\% of all
              events in Africa but that the nondetection rate declines
              dramatically when considering more significant events. We also
              show through regression analysis that deadly events, events of a
              larger magnitude, and events with government repression, among
              others, are significant predictors of overlapping reporting.
              Ultimately, the approach can be used to correct for undercounting
              in event data and to assess the quality of sources used.",

               game starts). Unlike specialized game players, such as Deep
               Blue, general game players cannot rely on algorithms designed in
               advance for specific games; they must discover such algorithms
               themselves. General game playing expertise depends on
               intelligence on the part of the game player and not just
               intelligence of the programmer of the game player. GGP is an
               interesting application in its own right. It is intellectually
               engaging and more than a little fun. But it is much more than

               into account problem representation and complexities like
               incompleteness of information and resource bounds. It has

               important, e.g., in business and law. More fundamentally, it
               raises questions about the nature of intelligence and serves as

               history. The need for valid statistical tools is greater than
               ever; data sets are massive, often measuring hundreds of
               thousands of measurements for a single subject. The field is
               ready to move towards clear objective benchmarks under which
               tools can be evaluated. Targeted learning allows (1) the full
               generalization and utilization of cross-validation as an
               estimator selection tool so that the subjective choices made by
               humans are now made by the machine, and (2) targeting the

              are necessarily symbolic. Because minds, along with everything

              physics are dynamical, minds are necessarily dynamical systems.
              Thus, the short answer to the opening question is ``yes.'' It
              makes sense to ask further whether some of the computations that

               posed a more radical problem for views on which minds can be
               understood as programs. Even his wall, he claims, implements the
               WordStar program according to the standard definition of
               implementation because there is some ``pattern of molecule
               movements'' that is isomorphic to the formal structure of
               WordStar. Program implementation, Searle charges, is merely
               observer-relative and thus not an intrinsic feature of the
               world. I argue, first, that analogous charges involving other
               concepts (motion and meaning) lead to consequences no one
               accepts. Second, I show that Searle’s treatment of computation
               is incoherent, yielding the consequence that nothing computes
               anything: even our standard personal computers fail to run any
               programs on this account. I propose an alternative account, one
               that accords with the way engineers, programmers, and cognitive
               scientists use the concept of computation in their empirical
               work. This alternative interpretation provides the basis of a
               philosophical analysis of program implementation, one that may

              for time travelers are described, all seeking a prescient mention
              of information not previously available. The first search covered
              prescient content placed on the Internet, highlighted by a
              comprehensive search for specific terms in tweets on Twitter. The
              second search examined prescient inquiries submitted to a search

              terms submitted to a popular astronomy web site. The third search
              involved a request for a direct Internet communication, either by
              email or tweet, pre-dating to the time of the inquiry. Given
              practical verifiability concerns, only time travelers from the

  abstract = "A combination of technological change, methodological drift and a
              certain degree of intellectual sloth, particularly with respect

              political analysis to accumulate a series of dysfunctional habits
              that have rendered much of contemporary research more or less
              meaningless. I identify these ‘seven deadly sins’ as: Garbage can
              models that ignore the effects of collinearity; Pre-scientific
              explanation in the absence of prediction; Excessive reanalysis of
              a small number of datasets; Using complex methods without
              understanding the underlying assumptions; Interpreting
              frequentist statistics as if they were Bayesian; A linear
              statistical monoculture that fails to consider alternative
              structures; Confusing statistical controls and experimental
              controls. The answer to these problems is not to abandon
              quantitative approaches, but rather engage in solid, thoughtful,
              original work driven by an appreciation of both theory and data.

               make it difficult to find an answer to a specific question
               because the information is stored at the document level and not
               the fact level. A lack of annotation about the content increases
               the cognitive load on the user, and not being able to capture
               and share annotations makes sense making and reach-back more
               challenging. These issues are cast into sharp relief within the
               realm of Civilian Affairs, in which efforts to engage the local
               population are often inadvertently duplicated due to the
               inexistence of records for past operations, and can be rendered
               ineffective due to a lack of sociocultural information about the
               area. In response to these challenges we developed the Marine
               Corps Civil Information Management (MarCIM) Semantic Wiki, a

                 mutations in MECP2, a nuclear protein that becomes
                 phosphorylated at S421 in response to neuronal activation. We
                 show here that disruption of MeCP2 S421 phosphorylation in

               collections of digital documents, especially textual documents.
               SOMs can be employed to analyse the content and relations
               between the documents in a collection, providing an intuitive
               access to large collections. In this paper, we apply this
               approach to analysing documents from the Internet platform
               WikiLeaks. This document collection is interesting for such an
               analysis for several aspects. For one, the documents contained
               cover a rather large time-span, thus there should also be an
               quite divergence in the topics discussed. Further, the documents
               stem from a magnitude of different sources, thus different
               styles should be expected. Moreover, the documents have very
               interesting, previously unpublished content. Finally, while the
               WikiLeaks website provides a way to browse all documents
               published by certain meta-data categories such as creation year
               and origin of the cable, there is no way to access the documents
               by their content. Thus, the SOM offers a valuable alternative
               mean to provide access to the content of the collection by their
               content. For analysing the document collection, we employ the
               Java SOMToolbox framework, which provides the user with a wealth
               of analysis and interaction methods, such as different
               visualisations, zooming and panning, and automatic labelling on
               different levels of granularity, to help the user in quickly
               getting an overview of and navigating in the collection.",

               policy, described by some as falling between diplomacy and
               military force. An important question regarding the use of
               sanctions is whether they can function as an alternative to
               military force by demonstrating the sender's resolve and making
               military force unnecessary, or if their use tends to result in
               an increased probability that military force will be used. Based
               on a theory of sanctions as costly signals, the authors develop
               and test hypotheses regarding the relationship between sanctions
               and military force. The results show that after a sanction
               occurs, there is a significantly increased probability of a use
               of military force. Democracies, because of their propensity to
               tie their hands with audience costs, while at the same time
               facing domestic pressure to devise sanctions to be costless to
               the sender, are highly likely to be involved in a militarized
               dispute after using sanctions.",

                 utmost importance in areas as diverse as disease spread,
                 resource allocation, and emergency response. Because of its
                 widespread availability and use, e-mail correspondence
                 provides an attractive proxy for studying human activity.
                 Recently, it was reported that the probability density for the
                 inter-event time tau between consecutively sent e-mails decays
                 asymptotically as tau(-alpha), with alpha approximately 1. The
                 slower-than-exponential decay of the inter-event time
                 distribution suggests that deliberate human activity is
                 inherently non-Poissonian. Here, we demonstrate that the
                 approximate power-law scaling of the inter-event time
                 distribution is a consequence of circadian and weekly cycles
                 of human activity. We propose a cascading nonhomogeneous
                 Poisson process that explicitly integrates these periodic
                 patterns in activity with an individual's tendency to continue
                 participating in an activity. Using standard statistical
                 techniques, we show that our model is consistent with the
                 empirical data. Our findings may also provide insight into the
                 origins of heavy-tailed distributions in other complex

  abstract  = "The success of ``infinite-inventory'' retailers such as
               Amazon.com and Netflix has been ascribed to a ``long tail''
               phenomenon. To wit, while the majority of their inventory is not
               in high demand, in aggregate these ``worst sellers,''
               unavailable at limited-inventory competitors, generate a
               significant fraction of total revenue. The long tail phenomenon,
               however, is in principle consistent with two fundamentally
               different theories. The first, and more popular hypothesis, is
               that a majority of consumers consistently follow the crowds and
               only a minority have any interest in niche content; the second
               hypothesis is that everyone is a bit eccentric, consuming both
               popular and specialty products. Based on examining extensive
               data on user preferences for movies, music, Web search, and Web
               browsing, we find overwhelming support for the latter theory.
               However, the observed eccentricity is much less than what is
               predicted by a fully random model whereby every consumer makes
               his product choices independently and proportional to product
               popularity; so consumers do indeed exhibit at least some a
               priori propensity toward either the popular or the exotic. Our
               findings thus suggest an additional factor in the success of
               infinite-inventory retailers, namely, that tail availability may
               boost head sales by offering consumers the convenience of
               ``one-stop shopping'' for both their mainstream and niche
               interests. This hypothesis is further supported by our
               theoretical analysis that presents a simple model in which
               shared inventory stores, such as Amazon Marketplace, gain a
               clear advantage by satisfying tail demand, helping to explain
               the emergence and increasing popularity of such retail
               arrangements. Hence, we believe that the return-on-investment
               (ROI) of niche products goes beyond direct revenue, extending to
               second-order gains associated with increased consumer
               satisfaction and repeat patronage. More generally, our findings
               call into question the conventional wisdom that specialty
               products only appeal to a minority of consumers.",

                 treatment of chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS) for many
                 years. Our new insights in to the mechanism of action of the
                 stellate ganglion block were first reported in 2007 in our
                 publication detailing the control of hot flashes with the use
                 of stellate ganglion blockade. We have demonstrated very
                 significant results in the treatment of hot flashes and our
                 most recent application of this block has been for the
                 treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Stellate

                 the commonality between the CRPS, HF and PTSD is the trigger
                 of increased nerve growth factor (NGF) leading to the increase
                 in brain norepinephrine (NR), which in turn is affected by the
                 SGB leading to a prolonged reduction of NGF and eventually a
                 decrease in NR. This, in turn, leads to a reduction or

               fanaticism does not explain why the world leader in suicide
               terrorism is the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, a group that adheres
               to a Marxist/Leninist ideology, while existing psychological
               explanations have been contradicted by the widening range of
               socio-economic backgrounds of suicide terrorists. To advance our
               understanding of this growing phenomenon, this study collects
               the universe of suicide terrorist attacks worldwide from 1980 to
               2001, 188 in all. In contrast to the existing explanations, this
               study shows that suicide terrorism follows a strategic logic,
               one specifically designed to coerce modern liberal democracies
               to make significant territorial concessions. Moreover, over the
               past two decades, suicide terrorism has been rising largely
               because terrorists have learned that it pays. Suicide terrorists
               sought to compel American and French military forces to abandon
               Lebanon in 1983, Israeli forces to leave Lebanon in 1985,
               Israeli forces to quit the Gaza Strip and the West Bank in 1994
               and 1995, the Sri Lankan government to create an independent
               Tamil state from 1990 on, and the Turkish government to grant
               autonomy to the Kurds in the late 1990s. In all but the case of
               Turkey, the terrorist political cause made more gains after the
               resort to suicide operations than it had before. Thus, Western
               democracies should pursue policies that teach terrorists that
               the lesson of the 1980s and 1990s no longer holds, policies
               which in practice may have more to do with improving homeland
               security than with offensive military action.",

              costs of analyzing even moderately sized collections of texts
              have hindered their use in political science research. Here lies
              the promise of automated text analysis: it substantially reduces
              the costs of analyzing large collections of text. We provide a
              guide to this exciting new area of research and show how, in many
              instances, the methods have already obtained part of their
              promise. But there are pitfalls to using automated methods---they
              are no substitute for careful thought and close reading and

  abstract    = "Current methods for the detection of contagious outbreaks give
                 contemporaneous information about the course of an epidemic at
                 best. It is known that individuals near the center of a social
                 network are likely to be infected sooner during the course of
                 an outbreak, on average, than those at the periphery.
                 Unfortunately, mapping a whole network to identify central
                 individuals who might be monitored for infection is typically
                 very difficult. We propose an alternative strategy that does
                 not require ascertainment of global network structure, namely,
                 simply monitoring the friends of randomly selected
                 individuals. Such individuals are known to be more central. To
                 evaluate whether such a friend group could indeed provide
                 early detection, we studied a flu outbreak at Harvard College
                 in late 2009. We followed 744 students who were either members
                 of a group of randomly chosen individuals or a group of their
                 friends. Based on clinical diagnoses, the progression of the
                 epidemic in the friend group occurred 13.9 days (95\% C.I.
                 9.9-16.6) in advance of the randomly chosen group (i.e., the
                 population as a whole). The friend group also showed a
                 significant lead time (p<0.05) on day 16 of the epidemic, a
                 full 46 days before the peak in daily incidence in the
                 population as a whole. This sensor method could provide
                 significant additional time to react to epidemics in small or
                 large populations under surveillance. The amount of lead time
                 will depend on features of the outbreak and the network at
                 hand. The method could in principle be generalized to other
                 biological, psychological, informational, or behavioral
                 contagions that spread in networks.",

              related to the percolation of worldwide spread passive
              supporters. This scheme puts the suppression of the percolation
              effect as the major strategic issue in the fight against
              terrorism. Accordingly the world density of passive supporters
              should be reduced below the percolation threshold. In terms of
              solid policy, it means to neutralize millions of random passive
              supporters, which is contrary to ethics and out of any sound
              practical scheme. Given this impossibility we suggest instead a
              new strategic scheme to act directly on the value of the
              terrorism percolation threshold itself without harming the
              passive supporters. Accordingly we identify the space hosting the
              percolation phenomenon to be a multi-dimensional virtual social
              space which extends the ground earth surface to include the
              various independent terrorist-fighting goals. The associated
              percolating cluster is then found to create long-range ground
              connections to terrorism activity. We are thus able to modify the
              percolation threshold pc in the virtual space to reach p<pc by
              decreasing the social space dimension, leaving the density p
              unchanged. At once that would break down the associated world
              terrorism network to a family of unconnected finite-size
              clusters. The current world terrorism threat would thus shrink
              immediately and spontaneously to a local geographic problem.

               Teregowda): Community size is often found to be negatively
               correlated with prosocial behaviors such as formal volunteering,
               working on public projects and informal help to friends and
               strangers (Putnam 2000, p. 119, 206). This may be because people
               who reside in large communities simply spend less time
               socializing with each other. As a result, people living in large
               cities have on average fewer friends, and hence their social
               networks support less cooperation. 1 A complementary channel,
               which has received less attention in the literature, is that
               community size may affect outcomes by changing other aspects of
               the network structure. Specifically, even holding fixed the
               number of friends, we expect social networks in small
               communities to exhibit greater network closure, i.e., be more
               interconnected. The intuition is straightforward: in small
               communities, the pool of potential friends is limited, which
               increases the extent to which the network neighborhoods of two
               friends are likely to overlap. Coleman (1990) suggested that
               variation in network closure can directly affect outcomes. In
               particular, he argued that networks with higher closure generate
               high trust between friends, which facilitates cooperation and
               thus improves welfare. The logic is that networks with high
               closure allow for greater social sanctions between individuals
               through common",

                 neural-network model for the analysis of high-dimensional
                 input data as in data mining applications. However, at least
                 two limitations have to be noted, which are related to the
                 static architecture of this model as well as to the limited
                 capabilities for the representation of hierarchical relations
                 of the data. With our novel growing hierarchical SOM (GHSOM)
                 we address both limitations. The GHSOM is an artificial
                 neural-network model with hierarchical architecture composed
                 of independent growing SOMs. The motivation was to provide a
                 model that adapts its architecture during its unsupervised
                 training process according to the particular requirements of
                 the input data. Furthermore, by providing a global orientation
                 of the independently growing maps in the individual layers of
                 the hierarchy, navigation across branches is facilitated. The
                 benefits of this novel neural network are a problem-dependent
                 architecture and the intuitive representation of hierarchical
                 relations in the data. This is especially appealing in
                 explorative data mining applications, allowing the inherent

              resolution is the rigid structure of the sociopsychological

              conflict. This article examines ways to overcome the rigidity of
              this repertoire in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian
              conflict. Specifically, in line with the prospect theory, the
              authors assumed that elicitation of beliefs about losses stemming
              from the continuing conflict may bring about a process of
              ``unfreezing.'' To test this assumption, an exploratory study
              with a national sample of the Israeli-Jewish population and two
              subsequent experimental studies were conducted. The results
              demonstrated that exposure to information about losses inherent
              in continuing the conflict induces higher willingness to acquire
              new information about possible solutions to the conflict, higher
              willingness to reevaluate current positions about it, and more
              support for compromises than the exposure to neutral information

               makes it easier for a reader to understand the data being used

               required in producing graphs is rewarded by greatly enhanced
               presentation and communication of empirical results. We
               illustrate their benefits by turning several published tables

               regression results. We show that regression graphs emphasize
               point estimates and confidence intervals and that they can
               successfully present the results of regression models. A move
               away from tables towards graphs would improve the discipline's

               modeling platform, we examine how domestic political
               institutions affect the ability of nations to trust and
               cooperate with each other. We propose a strategy, the
               agent-specific grim trigger, in which national leaders direct
               punishments for past defections at the leader of the nation
               responsible rather than at the nation itself. Leaders refuse to
               cooperate with those leaders who have cheated them in the past.
               However, by being prepared to cooperate with new leaders,
               cooperation can be restored. The focus of punishment on specific
               agents of the people (leaders), rather than the nation itself,
               means that citizens want to remove leaders who defect. Hence,
               domestically accountable leaders pay audience costs for failing
               to cooperate. These costs make accountable leaders more
               trustworthy and foster greater cooperation. In contrast, when
               replacing leaders is difficult, cooperation is less robust; and
               once cooperation falters, agent-specific punishment policies

              reforms are more likely to pass the legislative hurdle when
              patronage is evently distributed among the strongest parties, and
              (2) initial reforms are more likely to be followed by futher
              extensions of reform where the electoral weight of the top
              parties remains relatively even and stable. Attention to the
              incentives facing legislators and party leaders also results in

                 consisting of a long axon and multiple branching dendrites,
                 lies at the core of the principle of dynamic polarization,
                 whereby information flows from dendrites toward the soma and
                 to the axon. For more than a century, neuroscientists have
                 been fascinated by how shape is important for neuronal
                 function and how neurons acquire their characteristic
                 morphology. During the past decade, substantial progress has
                 been made in our understanding of the molecular underpinnings
                 of neuronal polarity and morphogenesis. In these studies,
                 transcription factors have emerged as key players governing
                 multiple aspects of neuronal morphogenesis from neuronal
                 polarization and migration to axon growth and pathfinding to
                 dendrite growth and branching to synaptogenesis. In this
                 review, we will highlight the role of transcription factors in
                 shaping neuronal morphology with emphasis on recent literature

              intellectual innovation in an era when threats posed by non-state
              terrorist organizations and their state supporters do not
              resemble Cold War threats. Based on an interpretative
              sociological reading of the concepts of power, security, and
              rationality, it argues that a ``damned if you do, damned if you
              don't'' dilemma is to the post-Cold War era what the danger of
              surprise attack or unintended nuclear war was to the Cold War:
              the defining structural threat of international politics. The
              dilemma leaves states confronting asymmetrical warfare with the
              choice of reacting with force to a terrorist act or practicing
              appeasement. Neither approach, however, can achieve the goal of
              putting an end to terrorism. Deterrence sustains the dilemma by
              providing a rationale for why force should be used and why
              self-restraint is irrational. This article proposes a third
              option, defusing, which may be accomplished by denial (preventing
              provocateurs from dragging states into the use of force) and
              restructuration (transforming the structure and rules of the
              situation). Defusing relies on ``performative power''---the
              capacity to project a dramatic and credible performance on the
              world stage and to decouple social actors, their audiences, and
              their most deeply held strategic beliefs. The force of the
              argument is illustrated by examples from the global ``war on
              terror,'' the 2006 Lebanon War, the 2008--09 operation ``Cast

  title    = "When Heads Roll: Assessing the Effectiveness of Leadership
              Decapitation",
  author   = "Jordan, Jenna",
  abstract = "Leadership targeting has become a key feature of current
              counterterrorism policies. Both academics and policy makers have
              argued that the removal of leaders is an effective strategy in
              combating terrorism. However, leadership decapitation is not
              always successful, and existing empirical work is insufficient to
              account for this variability. As a result, this project answers
              three primary questions: (1) Under what conditions does
              leadership decapitation result in the dissolution of a terrorist
              organization?; (2) Does leadership decapitation increase the
              likelihood of organizational collapse beyond the baseline rate of
              collapse for groups over time?; and (3) In cases where
              decapitation does not result in group collapse, to what extent
              does it result in organizational degradation and hinder a group's
              ability to carry about terrorist attacks? I develop a dataset of
              298 incidents of leadership targeting from 1945--2004 in order to
              determine whether and when decapitation is effective. First, I
              identify the conditions under which decapitation has been
              successful in bringing about organizational decline. The data
              show that a group's age, size, and type are critical in
              identifying when decapitation will cause the cessation of
              terrorist activity. As an organization grows in size and age, it
              is much more likely to withstand the removal of its leadership.
              Organizational type is also significant in understanding the
              susceptibility of an organization to decapitation. Ideological
              organizations are most likely to experience a cessation of
              activity following the removal of leader, while religious
              organizations are highly resistant to leadership decapitation.
              Second, I determine whether decapitation is an effective
              counterterrorism strategy that results in organizational
              collapse. The data show that decapitation does not increase the
              likelihood of organizational collapse beyond a baseline rate of
              collapse for groups over time. Organizations that have not had
              their leaders removed are more likely to fall apart than those
              that have undergone a loss of leadership. The marginal utility of
              decapitation is negative for many groups, particularly for
              larger, older, religious, and separatist organizations. Finally,
              I look at the extent to which decapitation results in
              organizational degradation and hinders a group's ability to carry
              about terrorist attacks. Case studies illustrate whether
              decapitation has an effect on the operational capacity of an
              organization by identifying whether the removal of key leaders
              changes the number and lethality of attacks. If certain
              organizations are more resilient than others, it is important to
              know when decapitation should be effective and when it could lead
              to counterproductive outcomes. Overall, these findings illustrate
              the need to develop a new model for evaluating the efficacy of
              leadership decapitation and for developing effective
              counterterrorism policies.",

              very little agreement on what constitutes high-quality
              government. The commentary suggests four approaches: (1)
              procedural measures, such as the Weberian criteria of
              bureaucratic modernity; (2) capacity measures, which include both
              resources and degree of professionalization; (3) output measures;
              and (4) measures of bureaucratic autonomy. It rejects output
              measures and suggests a two-dimensional framework of using
              capacity and autonomy as a measure of executive branch quality.
              This framework explains the conundrum of why low-income countries
              are advised to reduce bureaucratic autonomy while high-income
              ones seek to increase it.",

               vetoes, cases of political activism, or epidemiological
               infections) than zeros (``nonevents''). In many literatures,
               these variables have proven difficult to explain and predict, a
               problem that seems to have at least two sources. First, popular
               statistical procedures, such as logistic regression, can sharply
               underestimate the probability of rare events. We recommend
               corrections that outperform existing methods and change the
               estimates of absolute and relative risks by as much as some
               estimated effects reported in the literature. Second, commonly
               used data collection strategies are grossly inefficient for rare
               events data. The fear of collecting data with too few events has
               led to data collections with huge numbers of observations but
               relatively few, and poorly measured, explanatory variables, such
               as in international conflict data with more than a
               quarter-million dyads, only a few of which are at war. As it
               turns out, more efficient sampling designs exist for making
               valid inferences, such as sampling all available events (e.g.,
               wars) and a tiny fraction of nonevents (peace). This enables
               scholars to save as much as 99\% of their (nonfixed) data
               collection costs or to collect much more meaningful explanatory
               variables. We provide methods that link these two results,
               enabling both types of corrections to work simultaneously, and
               software that implements the methods developed.",

                 improving these problems. SAMPLE: The choice of topics is
                 based largely on the questions that authors, reviewers, and
                 editors have asked in recent years. The focus is on null

                 RESULTS: There are several ways to improve how statistics are
                 reported. These should improve both the authors' and the
                 readers' understanding of the data. CONCLUSIONS: Psychology as

                 similarity, we find that within a parameterized family of
                 social networks, network structure elicits opposing behavioral

  abstract  = "The killing of a head of state is among the most severe and
               consequential forms of political violence. But to date, there
               have been no systematic studies of the incidence of such
               assassinations, with the few existing case studies tending to
               emphasize the uniqueness of those events. Drawing on existing
               theories of social protest and contentious politics, we argue
               instead that institutional and sociopolitical factors should be
               important correlates of assassination. We examine empirically
               the implications of this theory, using data on the incidence of
               assassinations of heads of state between 1946 and 2000. Our
               findings suggest that institutional factors related to
               leadership succession, institutionalized power, and levels of
               repression interact to influence the occurrence of such
               killings. Notable in this respect is our conclusion that, while
               repressive leaders are at greater risk for assassination, the
               effect of repression is moderated by executive power, such that
               weak, repressive leaders in nondemocratic systems face the
               highest risk of assassination. Our findings dovetail neatly with
               the broader literature on other forms of insurgency, suggesting
               that assassinations are but one manifestation of the larger
               phenomenon of political violence.",

               foreign policy. Specifically, I expect a leader who offers
               unreciprocated cooperation to a rival (a dove) to be more likely
               to be deselected from power than a leader that takes a harder
               line vis-\`{a}-vis the rival (a hawk). I test expectation using
               event history techniques and data spanning the 1950-1990 time
               period and find strong evidence that dovish leaders pay an
               electoral price within a rivalry context. The findings suggest
               an internationally contingent domestic incentive to maintain
               rivalry and conflict over time.",

               the quantitative study of international conflict: Despite
               immense data collections, prestigious journals, and
               sophisticated analyses, empirical findings in the literature on
               international conflict are often unsatisfying. Many statistical
               results change from article to article and specification to
               specification. Accurate forecasts are nonexistent. In this
               article we offer a conjecture about one source of this problem:
               The causes of conflict, theorized to be important but often
               found to be small or ephemeral, are indeed tiny for the vast
               majority of dyads, but they are large, stable, and replicable
               wherever the ex ante probability of conflict is large. This
               simple idea has an unexpectedly rich array of observable
               implications, all consistent with the literature. We directly
               test our conjecture by formulating a statistical model that
               includes its critical features. Our approach, a version of a
               ``neural network'' model, uncovers some interesting structural
               features of international conflict and, as one evaluative
               measure, forecasts substantially better than any previous
               effort. Moreover, this improvement comes at little cost, and it
               is easy to evaluate whether the model is a statistical
               improvement over the simpler models commonly used.",

  abstract = "Political units often spatially depend in their policy choices on
              other units. This also holds in dyadic settings where, as in much
              of international relations research, analysis focuses on the
              interaction or relation between a pair or dyad of two political
              units. Yet, with few exceptions, social scientists have analyzed
              contagion in monadic datasets only, consisting of individual
              political units. This article categorizes all possible forms of
              spatial effect modeling in both undirected and directed dyadic
              data, where it is possible to distinguish the source and the
              target of interaction (for example, exporter/importer,
              aggressor/victim, and so on). This approach enables scholars to
              formulate and test novel mechanisms of contagion, thus ideally
              paving the way for studies analyzing spatial dependence between
              dyads of political units. To illustrate the modeling flexibility
              gained from an understanding of the full set of specification
              options for spatial effects in dyadic data, we examine the
              diffusion of bilateral investment treaties between developed and
              developing countries, building and extending on Elkins, Guzman,
              and Simmons's 2006 study. However, we come to different
              conclusions about the channels through which bilateral investment
              treaties diffuse. Rather than a capital-importing country being
              influenced by the total number of BITs signed by other capital
              importers, as modeled in their original article, we find that a
              capital-importing country is more likely to sign a BIT with a
              capital exporter only if other competing capital importers have
              signed BITs with this very same capital exporter. Similarly,
              other capital exporters' BITs with a specific capital importer
              influence an exporter's incentive to agree on a BIT with the very
              same capital importer.",

               a challenger state can consult an international organization
               whose decisions can affect its costs for war. We demonstrate
               that, first, while multilateral opposition lowers the
               probability of war by coordinating international opposition and
               increasing the costs of fighting multilateral support can
               increase the probability of war by coordinating support and
               lowering those costs. Second, the aggregate effect of IO
               involvement on the probability of war is conditional on the
               strategic decisions of challengers to initially consult the
               organization, implying that any empirical analysis of the
               pacific effects of IOs should take this selection process

               address broader debates about the role of international

               of their current employing departments. Scores are derived as
               solutions to linear simultaneous equations in the values. The
               sample includes the top 58 departments, the composition of which
               is determined endogenously, invoking a criterion requiring more
               than three placements in the sample. Illuminating the current
               state and trends of economics PhD education, the conclusions
               should be of broad interest to PhD candidates, academics, and

                 distributions of casualties both in whole wars from 1816 to
                 1980 and terrorist attacks have separately been shown to
                 follow approximate power-law distributions. However, the
                 possibility of universal patterns ranging across wars in the
                 size distribution or timing of within-conflict events has
                 barely been explored. Here we show that the sizes and timing

                 remarkable similarities. We propose a unified model of human
                 insurgency that reproduces these commonalities, and explains
                 conflict-specific variations quantitatively in terms of
                 underlying rules of engagement. Our model treats each
                 insurgent population as an ecology of dynamically evolving,
                 self-organized groups following common decision-making
                 processes. Our model is consistent with several recent
                 hypotheses about modern insurgency, is robust to many
                 generalizations, and establishes a quantitative connection
                 between human insurgency, global terrorism and ecology. Its

                 intervals is necessary for the evaluation of scientific
                 articles. This article will inform the reader of the meaning
                 and interpretation of these two statistical concepts. METHODS:
                 The uses of these two statistical concepts and the differences
                 between them are discussed on the basis of a selective
                 literature search concerning the methods employed in
                 scientific articles. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: P-values in
                 scientific studies are used to determine whether a null
                 hypothesis formulated before the performance of the study is
                 to be accepted or rejected. In exploratory studies, p-values
                 enable the recognition of any statistically noteworthy
                 findings. Confidence intervals provide information about a
                 range in which the true value lies with a certain degree of
                 probability, as well as about the direction and strength of
                 the demonstrated effect. This enables conclusions to be drawn
                 about the statistical plausibility and clinical relevance of
                 the study findings. It is often useful for both statistical
                 measures to be reported in scientific articles, because they

  abstract  = "A central question in intrastate conflicts is how insurgents are
               able to mobilize supporters to participate in violent and risky
               activities. A common explanation is that violence committed by
               counterinsurgent forces mobilizes certain segments of the
               population through a range of mechanisms. We study the effects
               of civilian casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan to quantify the
               effect of such casualties on subsequent insurgent violence. By
               comparing uniquely detailed micro-data along temporal, spatial,
               and gender dimensions we can distinguish short-run 'information'
               and 'capacity' effects from the longer run 'propaganda' and
               'revenge' effects. In Afghanistan we find strong evidence that
               local exposure to civilian casualties caused by international
               forces leads to increased insurgent violence over the long-run,
               what we term the 'revenge' effect. Matching districts with
               similar past trends in violence shows that
               counterinsurgent-generated civilian casualties from a typical
               incident are responsible for 1 additional violent incident in an
               average sized district in the following 6 weeks and lead to
               increased violence over the next 6 months. There is no evidence
               that out-of-area eventserrant air strikes for examplelead to
               increased violence, nor is there evidence of short run effects,
               thus ruling out the propaganda, information, and capacity
               mechanisms. Critically, we find no evidence of a similar
               reaction to civilian casualties in Iraq, suggesting the
               constraints on insurgent production of violence may be quite
               conflict-specific. Our results imply that minimizing harm to
               civilians may indeed help counterinsurgent forces in Afghanistan
               to reduce insurgent recruitment.",

                   disciplines in the natural, social, and information
                   sciences. Here we introduce a framework for constructing
                   taxonomies of networks based on their structural
                   similarities. These networks can arise from any of numerous
                   sources: they can be empirical or synthetic, they can arise
                   from multiple realizations of a single process, empirical or
                   synthetic, or they can represent entirely different systems
                   in different disciplines. Since the mesoscopic properties of
                   networks are hypothesized to be important for network
                   function, we base our comparisons on summaries of network
                   community structures. While we use a specific method for
                   uncovering network communities, much of the introduced

                   individual networks and demonstrate that our approach
                   usefully identifies similar networks. We also construct
                   taxonomies within individual categories of networks, and in
                   each case we expose non-trivial structure. For example we

               the dynamics of simulation models that have been implemented and
               can be run in a computer, i.e. computer models. To do that, we
               start by explaining (a) that computer models are just
               input-output functions, (b) that every computer model can be
               re-implemented in many different formalisms (in particular in
               most programming languages), leading to alternative
               representations of the same input-output relation, and (c) that
               many computer models in the social simulation literature can be
               usefully represented as time-homogeneous Markov chains. Then we
               argue that analysing a computer model as a Markov chain can make
               apparent many features of the model that were not so evident
               before conducting such analysis. To prove this point, we present
               the main concepts needed to conduct a formal analysis of any
               time-homogeneous Markov chain, and we illustrate the usefulness
               of these concepts by analysing 10 well-known models in the
               social simulation literature as Markov chains. These models are:
               Schelling's (1971) model of spatial segregation Epstein and
               Axtell's (1996) Sugarscape Miller and Page's (2004) standing
               ovation model Arthur's (1989) model of competing technologies
               Axelrod's (1986) metanorms models Takahashi's (2000) model of
               generalized exchange Axelrod's (1997) model of dissemination of
               culture Kinnaird's (1946) truels Axelrod and Bennett's (1993)
               model of competing bimodal coalitions Joyce et al.'s (2006)
               model of conditional association In particular, we explain how
               to characterise the transient and the asymptotic dynamics of
               these computer models and, where appropriate, how to assess the
               stochastic stability of their absorbing states. In all cases,

  abstract    = "Reasoning is generally seen as a means to improve knowledge
                 and make better decisions. However, much evidence shows that
                 reasoning often leads to epistemic distortions and poor
                 decisions. This suggests that the function of reasoning should
                 be rethought. Our hypothesis is that the function of reasoning
                 is argumentative. It is to devise and evaluate arguments
                 intended to persuade. Reasoning so conceived is adaptive given
                 the exceptional dependence of humans on communication and
                 their vulnerability to misinformation. A wide range of
                 evidence in the psychology of reasoning and decision making
                 can be reinterpreted and better explained in the light of this
                 hypothesis. Poor performance in standard reasoning tasks is
                 explained by the lack of argumentative context. When the same
                 problems are placed in a proper argumentative setting, people
                 turn out to be skilled arguers. Skilled arguers, however, are
                 not after the truth but after arguments supporting their
                 views. This explains the notorious confirmation bias. This
                 bias is apparent not only when people are actually arguing,
                 but also when they are reasoning proactively from the
                 perspective of having to defend their opinions. Reasoning so
                 motivated can distort evaluations and attitudes and allow
                 erroneous beliefs to persist. Proactively used reasoning also
                 favors decisions that are easy to justify but not necessarily
                 better. In all these instances traditionally described as
                 failures or flaws, reasoning does exactly what can be expected
                 of an argumentative device: Look for arguments that support a
                 given conclusion, and, ceteris paribus, favor conclusions for
                 which arguments can be found.",

               large, recent, and nationally representative panel of US
               children. There are no mean differences between boys and girls
               upon entry to school, but girls lose more than two-tenths of a
               standard deviation relative to boys over the first six years of
               school. The ground lost by girls relative to boys is roughly
               half as large as the black-white test score gap that appears
               over these same ages. We document the presence of this gender
               math gap across every strata of society. We explore a wide range
               of possible explanations in the data, including less investment
               by girls in math, low parental expectations, and biased tests,

               cross-country comparisons, we find earlier results linking the
               gender gap in math to measures of gender equality are sensitive
               to the inclusion of Muslim countries, where, in spite of women's

  author    = "Summers, Lawrence H and Summers, Victoria P",
  abstract  = "Unlike most major industrialized nations, the United States does
               not impose an excise tax on securities transactions. This
               article examines the desirability and feasibility of
               implementating a U.S. Securities Transfer Excise Tax (STET)
               directed at curbing excesses associated with short-term
               speculation and at raising revenue. We conclude that strong
               economic efficiency arguments can be made in support of a STET
               that throws ``sand into the gears,'' in James Tobin's (1982)
               phrase, of our excessively well-functioning financial markets.
               Such a tax would have the beneficial effects of curbing
               instability introduced by speculation, reducing the diversion of
               resources into the financial sector of the economy, and
               lengthening the horizons of corporate managers. The efficiency
               benefits derived from curbing speculation are likely to exceed
               any costs of reduced liquidity or increased costs of capital
               that come from taxing financial transactions more heavily. The
               examples of Japan and the United Kingdom suggest that a STET is
               administratively feasible and can be implemented without
               crippling the competitiveness of U.S. financial markets. A STET
               at a .5\% rate could raise revenues of at least $10 billion

  title    = "An optimum-currency-area odyssey",

  abstract = "The theory of optimum-currency-areas was conceived and developed
              in three highly influential papers, written by Mundell (1961),
              McKinnon (1963) and Kenen (1969). Those authors identified
              characteristics that potential members of a monetary union should
              ideally possess in order to make it feasible to surrender a
              nationally-tailored monetary policy and the adjustment of an
              exchange rate of a national currency. We trace the development of
              optimum-currency-area theory, which, after a flurry of research
              into the subject in the 1960s, was relegated to intellectual
              purgatory for about 20 years. We then discuss factors that led to
              a renewed interest into the subject, beginning in the early
              1990s. Milton Friedman plays a pivotal role in our narrative;
              Friedman's work on monetary integration in the early 1950s
              presaged subsequent optimum-currency-area contributions;
              Mundell's classic formulation of an optimal currency area was
              aimed, in part, at refuting Friedman's ``strong'' case for
              floating exchange rates; and Friedman's work on the role of
              monetary policy had the effect of helping to revive interest in
              optimum-currency-area analysis. The paper concludes with a
              discussion of recent analytical work, using New Keynesian models,
              which has the promise of fulfilling the unfinished agenda set-out
              by the original contributors to the optimum-currency-area
              literature, that is, providing a consistent framework in which a
              country's characteristics can be used to determine its optimal
              exchange-rate regime.",

                 immigrants in California use health services in Mexico.
                 METHODS: California Health Interview Survey 2001 data were
                 analyzed for medical care, dental care, and/or prescription
                 drug purchases in Mexico in the previous year. Logistic
                 regressions estimated the effect on use of need, availability,
                 accessibility, and acceptability among immigrants from Mexico.
                 RESULTS: An estimated 952,000 California adults used medical,
                 dental, or prescription services in Mexico during the past
                 year, of whom 488,000 were Mexican immigrants. Long-stay
                 Mexican immigrants had the highest rate (15\%), followed by
                 short-stay Mexican immigrants (11.5\%), US-born Mexican
                 Americans (5.4\%), and US-born nonLatino whites (2.1\%).
                 Predictors of use by immigrants included need, no insurance,
                 delay seeking care, more recent immigration, limited English,
                 and nonphysician provider use. Living closer to the border
                 increased use, although half of immigrants seeking services
                 lived more than 120 miles from the border. Mexican immigrants
                 with long stays in the US have a somewhat different pattern of
                 predictors from those with short stays. CONCLUSIONS: Mexican
                 immigrants are the most likely to seek medical, dental, and
                 prescription services in Mexico. A large number, but small
                 percentages, of US-born nonLatino whites purchase prescription
                 drugs there. Although proximity facilitates use, access and
                 acceptability barriers in the US medical care system encourage
                 immigrants to seek care in Mexico who would be helped by
                 expanded binational health insurance.",

              the last few years and will continue to increase in importance as
              broadband technologies and authoring tools continue to improve.
              As the Internet becomes an increasingly popular alternative to
              traditional communications media, Internet streaming will become
              a significant component of many content providers' communications
              strategies. Internet streaming, however, poses significant
              challenges for content providers, since it has significant
              distribution problems. Scalability, quality, reliability, and
              cost are all issues that have to be addressed in a successful
              streaming media offering. Streaming content delivery networks
              (streaming CDNs) attempt to provide solutions to the bottlenecks
              encountered by streaming applications on the Internet. However,
              only a small number of them has been deployed, and little is
              known about the internal organization of these systems. In this
              paper, we discuss the design choices made during the evolution of
              Akamai's CDN for streaming media. In particular, we look at the
              design choices made to ensure the network's scalability, quality
              of delivered content, and reliability while keeping costs low.
              Performance studies conducted on the evolving system indicate
              that our design scores highly on all of the above categories.",

              Institutional arguments frequently imply that the relationship

              institutional context. Models of strategic interaction typically
              produce conditional hypotheses as well. Although conditional
              hypotheses are ubiquitous in political science and multiplicative
              interaction models have been found to capture their intuition
              quite well, a survey of the top three political science journals
              from 1998 to 2002 suggests that the execution of these models is
              often flawed and inferential errors are common. We believe that
              considerable progress in our understanding of the political world
              can occur if scholars follow the simple checklist of dos and
              don'ts for using multiplicative interaction models presented in

              evidence suggests that a predisposition to favor in-groups can be
              easily triggered by even arbitrary group distinctions and that
              preferential cooperation within groups occurs even when it is

  abstract = "Intelligence analysis is a complicated task that requires a high
              degree of analytical judgement under conditions of considerable
              uncertainty. This judgement is used to fill in the gaps in
              knowledge and is the analyst's principal means of managing
              uncertainty. Much of intelligence analysis includes judging the
              relevance and the value of evidence to determine the likelihood
              of competing hypotheses. The challenge is to create better formal
              methods of analysis that can be used under a wider variety of
              circumstances and which can handle both empirical data and
              formally-expressed beliefs as evidence for or against each
              hypothesis. The authors have developed a formal approach to the
              evaluation of competing hypotheses that is based on the belief
              calculus known as Subjective Logic. The development of this
              formal approach allows for integration of empirical and
              statistical data, as well as for judgements made by analysts.
              Lastly, this formal approach makes redundant the separate
              analysis of ``diagnosticity of evidence''. Under this formal
              approach, diagnosticity is formally derived from the model and
              need not be considered as a separate input to the model, except
              as a means of limiting the initial set of evidence that should be

                 designed to simulate those for the sensory evaluation. Sixteen
                 characteristic ion traces in the headspace were quantified by
                 PTR-MS, requiring only 2 min of headspace measurement per
                 espresso. The correlation is based on a knowledge-based
                 standardization and normalization of both datasets that
                 selectively extracts differences in the quality of samples,
                 while reducing the impact of variations on the overall
                 intensity of coffees. This work represents a significant
                 progress in terms of correlation of sensory with instrumental
                 results exemplified on coffee.",

  abstract = "This article and the companion paper aim at reviewing recent
              empirical and theoretical developments usually grouped under the
              term Econophysics. Since the name was coined in 1995 by merging
              the words ‘Economics’ and ‘Physics’, this new interdisciplinary
              field has grown in various directions: theoretical macroeconomics
              (wealth distribution), microstructure of financial markets (order
              book modeling), econometrics of financial bubbles and crashes,
              etc. We discuss the interactions between Physics, Mathematics,
              Economics and Finance that led to the emergence of Econophysics.
              We then present empirical studies revealing the statistical
              properties of financial time series. We begin the presentation
              with the widely acknowledged ‘stylized facts’, which describe the
              returns of financial assets---fat tails, volatility clustering,
              autocorrelation, etc.---and recall that some of these properties
              are directly linked to the way ‘time’ is taken into account. We
              continue with the statistical properties observed on order books
              in financial markets. For the sake of illustrating this review,
              (nearly) all the stated facts are reproduced using our own
              high-frequency financial database. Finally, contributions to the
              study of correlations of assets such as random matrix theory and
              graph theory are presented. The companion paper will review
              models in Econophysics from the point of view of agent-based

  abstract = "The importance of graphical displays in statistical practice has
              been recognized sporadically in the statistical literature over
              the past century, with wider awareness following Tukey's
              Exploratory Data Analysis and Tufte's books in the succeeding
              decades. But statistical graphics still occupy an awkward
              in-between position: within statistics, exploratory and graphical
              methods represent a minor subfield and are not well integrated
              with larger themes of modeling and inference. Outside of
              statistics, infographics (also called information visualization
              or Infovis) are huge, but their purveyors and enthusiasts appear
              largely to be uninterested in statistical principles. We present
              here a set of goals for graphical displays discussed primarily
              from the statistical point of view and discuss some inherent
              contradictions in these goals that may be impeding communication
              between the fields of statistics and Infovis. One of our
              constructive suggestions, to Infovis practitioners and
              statisticians alike, is to try not to cram into a single graph
              what can be better displayed in two or more. We recognize that we
              offer only one perspective and intend this article to be a
              starting point for a wide-ranging discussion among graphic
              designers, statisticians, and users of statistical methods. The

                 Six studies are presented as a naturalistic investigation of
                 the effects of mere exposure to images in his collection and
                 to those matched to them. The probabilities of cultural
                 exposure to the 132 stimulus images were indexed by the
                 frequencies of their separate appearances in Cornell
                 University library books--a total of 4,232 times in 980
                 different books. Across the studies, adult preferences were
                 correlated with differences in image frequencies, but not with
                 recognition, complexity, or prototypicality judgments;
                 children's preferences were not correlated with frequency.
                 Prior cultural exposure also interacted with experimental
                 exposure in predictable ways. The results suggest that mere

                   point for discussion in everyday life. Formal statistical
                   models for the analysis of network data have emerged as a
                   major topic of interest in diverse areas of study, and most
                   of these involve a form of graphical representation.
                   Probability models on graphs date back to 1959. Along with
                   empirical studies in social psychology and sociology from
                   the 1960s, these early works generated an active network
                   community and a substantial literature in the 1970s. This
                   effort moved into the statistical literature in the late
                   1970s and 1980s, and the past decade has seen a burgeoning
                   network literature in statistical physics and computer
                   science. The growth of the World Wide Web and the emergence
                   of online networking communities such as Facebook, MySpace,
                   and LinkedIn, and a host of more specialized professional
                   network communities has intensified interest in the study of
                   networks and network data. Our goal in this review is to
                   provide the reader with an entry point to this burgeoning
                   literature. We begin with an overview of the historical
                   development of statistical network modeling and then we
                   introduce a number of examples that have been studied in the
                   network literature. Our subsequent discussion focuses on a
                   number of prominent static and dynamic network models and
                   their interconnections. We emphasize formal model
                   descriptions, and pay special attention to the
                   interpretation of parameters and their estimation. We end
                   with a description of some open problems and challenges for
                   machine learning and statistics.",

              turnout at a reasonable level under a wide range of conditions.
              The main contributions of this paper are: (1) to show how, for an
              individual with both selfish and social preferences, the social
              preferences will dominate and make it rational for a typical
              person to vote even in large elections; (2) to show that rational
              socially motivated voting has a feedback mechanism that
              stabilizes turnout at reasonable levels (e.g., 50\% of the
              electorate); (3) to link the rational social-utility model of
              voter turnout with survey findings on socially motivated vote

              approaches to inductive inference in the philosophy of science
              literature. My first concern will be the general principles that
              underlie the many accounts of induction in this literature. When
              these accounts are considered in isolation, as is more commonly
              the case, it is easy to overlook that virtually all accounts
              depend on one of very few basic principles and that the
              proliferation of accounts can be understood as efforts to
              ameliorate the weaknesses of those few principles. In the earlier
              sections, I will lay out three inductive principles and the
              families of accounts of induction they engender. In later
              sections I will review standard problems in the philosophical
              literature that have supported some pessimism about induction and
              suggest that their import has been greatly overrated. In the
              final sections I will return to the proliferation of accounts of
              induction that frustrates efforts at a final codification. I will
              suggest that this proliferation appears troublesome only as long
              as we expect inductive inference to be subsumed under a single
              formal theory. If we adopt a material theory of induction in
              which individual inductions are licensed by particular facts that
              prevail only in local domains, then the proliferation is expected
              and not problematic.",

  abstract = "Both anecdotal and case-study evidence have long suggested that
              consumer behavior such as the buying or boycotting of products
              and services for political and ethical reasons can take on
              political significance. Despite recent claims that such behavior
              has become more widespread in recent years, political consumerism
              has not been studied systematically in survey research on
              political participation. Through the use of a pilot survey
              conducted among 1015 Canadian, Belgian, and Swedish students, we
              ascertain whether political consumerism is a sufficiently
              consistent behavioral pattern to be measured and studied
              meaningfully. The data from this pilot survey allow us to build a
              ``political consumerism index'' incorporating attitudinal,
              behavioral, and frequency measurements. Our analysis of this
              cross-national student sample suggests that political consumerism
              is primarily a tool of those who are distrustful of political
              institutions. However, political consumers have more trust in
              other citizens, and they are disproportionately involved in
              checkbook organizations. They also tend to score highly on
              measures of political efficacy and post-materialism. We strongly
              suggest including measurements of political consumerism together
              with other emerging forms of activism in future population
              surveys on political participation.",

                 commencement of exercise habits with long-term consequences. A
                 cross-sectional survey in two Australian cities, Melbourne and
                 Perth, aimed to collect, by parent self-administered
                 questionnaire, population-based data on modes of travel,
                 numbers of street crossings (both accompanied and
                 unaccompanied by an adult), and sociodemographic factors for
                 six- and nine-year-old children. Results indicate that 35 per
                 cent (95 per cent confidence interval (CI) 31 to 39 per cent)
                 and 31 per cent (CI 28 to 34 per cent) walk to school in
                 Melbourne and Perth respectively, while over 60 per cent are
                 driven to school by car, with very small proportions riding
                 bicycles or taking public transport. A higher level of walking
                 was associated with lower levels of several indicators of
                 socioeconomic status. Logistic regression analysis showed that
                 the strongest predictor of walking activity was school type
                 (government versus independent), and after adjusting for this,
                 lesser car ownership, non-English-speaking background and

                 school, while a different set of predictors--age, sex and
                 maternal education--was associated with the unaccompanied
                 crossing of streets. There was little difference in overall
                 walking levels between boys and girls, but boys were
                 significantly more likely to cross streets unaccompanied

  title    = "Explaining Interstate Conflict and War: What Should Be Controlled
              for?",
  author   = "Lee Ray, James",
  abstract = "Most multivariate models designed by analysts of intemational
              conflict focus on one key explanatory factor and include several
              control variables. There are prominent norms or customs in the
              subfield of international politics regarding the construction of
              multivariate models and the selection of control variables.
              Several of these norms or customs may make the results of
              multivariate analyses confusing and difficult to interpret.
              Analysts typically do not, for example, distinguish between
              confounding and intervening variables even though the
              implications and impacts of such variables are substantially
              different. Most researchers also fail to distinguish between
              confounding variables and variables that have an impact on
              interstate conflict that is complementary to that of the key
              explanatory factor. Commonly, control variables are included in a
              model for no other reason than that they also have an impact on
              interstate conflict or some other outcome variable. In some
              recent analyses, ``independent'' variables are included that are
              related by definition to the key explanatory variable, or to each
              other. This practice introduces into multivariate models
              artifactual, misleading degrees of statistical association
              between variables related to each other by definition with
              tautological relationships masquerading as empirical causal
              connections that complicate the interpretation of results.
              Finally, the construction of pooled cross-sectional, time series
              analyses is consistently based on the assumption that the key
              explanatory factor, as well as the control variables, have
              essentially identical impacts on interstate conflict across
              space, and over time. Substantial evidence, some of which is
              provided in this paper, suggests that this assumption is
              unwarranted. This paper provides five guidelines for the
              construction of multivariate models that address these issues in
              a manner aimed at making the results of multivariate analyses
              more intelligible and credible.",

              two behavioral concepts. First, investors are assumed to be

              to losses than to gains. Second, even long-term investors are

               possible electoral reform. While most of the popular and
               academic accounts focused on balloting irregularities in
               Florida, such as the now infamous ``butterfly'' ballot and
               mishandled absentee ballots, some also noted that this election
               marked only the fourth time in history that the candidate with a
               plurality of the popular vote did not also win the Electoral
               College. This ``anti-democratic'' outcome has fueled desire for
               reform or even outright elimination of the electoral college. We
               show that after appropriate statistical analysis of the
               available historical electoral data, there is little basis to
               argue for reforming the Electoral College. We first show that
               while the Electoral College may once have been biased against
               the Democrats, the current distribution of voters advantages
               neither party. Further, the electoral vote will differ from the
               popular vote only when the average vote shares of the two major
               candidates are extremely close to 50 percent. As for individual
               voting power, we show that while there has been much temporal
               variation in relative voting power over the last several
               decades, the voting power of individual citizens would not

                 inflated effects compared with the true effect sizes. I
                 discuss here the main reasons for this inflation. First,
                 theoretical considerations prove that when true discovery is
                 claimed based on crossing a threshold of statistical
                 significance and the discovery study is underpowered, the
                 observed effects are expected to be inflated. This has been
                 demonstrated in various fields ranging from early stopped
                 clinical trials to genome-wide associations. Second, flexible
                 analyses coupled with selective reporting may inflate the
                 published discovered effects. The vibration ratio (the ratio
                 of the largest vs. smallest effect on the same association
                 approached with different analytic choices) can be very large.
                 Third, effects may be inflated at the stage of interpretation
                 due to diverse conflicts of interest. Discovered effects are
                 not always inflated, and under some circumstances may be
                 deflated-for example, in the setting of late discovery of
                 associations in sequentially accumulated overpowered evidence,
                 in some types of misclassification from measurement error, and
                 in conflicts causing reverse biases. Finally, I discuss
                 potential approaches to this problem. These include being
                 cautious about newly discovered effect sizes, considering some
                 rational down-adjustment, using analytical methods that
                 correct for the anticipated inflation, ignoring the magnitude
                 of the effect (if not necessary), conducting large studies in
                 the discovery phase, using strict protocols for analyses,
                 pursuing complete and transparent reporting of all results,
                 placing emphasis on replication, and being fair with

                 fitting multilevel or hierarchical linear models, especially
                 when the number of groups is small. For situations where zero
                 variances are implausible a priori, we propose a maximum
                 penalized likelihood approach to avoid such boundary
                 estimates. This approach is equivalent to estimating variance
                 parameters by their posterior mode, given a weakly informative
                 prior distribution. By choosing the penalty from the log-gamma
                 family with shape parameter greater than 1, we ensure that the
                 estimated variance will be positive. We suggest a default
                 log-gamma(2,$\lambda$) penalty with $\lambda$ → 0, which
                 ensures that the maximum penalized likelihood estimate is
                 approximately one standard error from zero when the maximum
                 likelihood estimate is zero, thus remaining consistent with
                 the data while being nondegenerate. We also show that the
                 maximum penalized likelihood estimator with this default
                 penalty is a good approximation to the posterior median
                 obtained under a noninformative prior.Our default method
                 provides better estimates of model parameters and standard
                 errors than the maximum likelihood or the restricted maximum
                 likelihood estimators. The log-gamma family can also be used
                 to convey substantive prior information. In either case-pure
                 penalization or prior information-our recommended procedure
                 gives nondegenerate estimates and in the limit coincides with
                 maximum likelihood as the number of groups increases.",

  abstract = "The panic of 2007--2008 was a run on the sale and repurchase
              market (the repo market), which is a very large, short-term
              market that provides financing for a wide range of securitization
              activities and financial institutions. Repo transactions are
              collateralized, frequently with securitized bonds. We refer to
              the combination of securitization plus repo finance as
              ``securitized banking'' and argue that these activities were at
              the nexus of the crisis. We use a novel data set that includes
              credit spreads for hundreds of securitized bonds to trace the
              path of the crisis from subprime-housing related assets into
              markets that had no connection to housing. We find that changes
              in the LIB-OIS spread, a proxy for counterparty risk, were
              strongly correlated with changes in credit spreads and repo rates
              for securitized bonds. These changes implied higher uncertainty
              about bank solvency and lower values for repo collateral.
              Concerns about the liquidity of markets for the bonds used as
              collateral led to increases in repo haircuts, that is the amount
              of collateral required for any given transaction. With declining
              asset values and increasing haircuts, the US banking system was
              effectively insolvent for the first time since the Great
              Depression.",

  abstract  = "This paper is a self-contained survey of algorithms for
               computing Nash equilibria of two-person games. The games may be
               given in strategic form or extensive form. The classical
               Lemke-Howson algorithm finds one equilibrium of a bimatrix game,
               and provides an elementary proof that a Nash equilibrium exists.
               It can be given a strong geometric intuition using graphs that
               show the subdivision of the players' mixed strategy sets into
               best-response regions. The Lemke-Howson algorithm is presented
               with these graphs, as well as algebraically in terms of
               complementary pivoting. Degenerate games require a refinement of
               the algorithm based on lexicographic perturbations. Commonly
               used definitions of degenerate games are shown as equivalent.
               The enumeration of all equilibria is expressed as the problem of
               finding matching vertices in pairs of polytopes. Algorithms for
               computing simply stable equilibria and perfect equilibria are
               explained. The computation of equilibria for extensive games is
               difficult for larger games since the reduced strategic form may
               be exponentially large compared to the game tree. If the players
               have perfect recall, the sequence form of the extensive game is
               a strategic description that is more suitable for computation.
               In the sequence form, pure strategies of a player are replaced
               by sequences of choices along a play in the game. The sequence
               form has the same size as the game tree, and can be used for
               computing equilibria with the same methods as the strategic
               form. The paper concludes with remarks on theoretical and
               practical issues of concern to these computational approaches.",

                 scale of the inputs. One method often used to place input
                 variables on a common scale is to divide each numeric variable
                 by its standard deviation. Here we propose dividing each
                 numeric variable by two times its standard deviation, so that
                 the generic comparison is with inputs equal to the mean +/-1
                 standard deviation. The resulting coefficients are then
                 directly comparable for untransformed binary predictors. We
                 have implemented the procedure as a function in R. We
                 illustrate the method with two simple analyses that are
                 typical of applied modeling: a linear regression of data from
                 the National Election Study and a multilevel logistic

  author   = "Gelman, Andrew",
  abstract = "Abstract We present a computational approach to the method of
              moments using Monte Carlo simulation. Simple algebraic identities
              are used so that all computations can be performed directly using
              simulation draws and computation of the derivative of the
              log-likelihood. We present a simple implementation using the
              Newton-Raphson algorithm with the understanding that other
              optimization methods may be used in more complicated problems.
              The method can be applied to families of distributions with
              unknown normalizing constants and can be extended to least
              squares fitting in the case that the number of moments observed
              exceeds the number of parameters in the model. The method can be
              further generalized to allow ``moments'' that are any function of
              data and parameters, including as a special case maximum
              likelihood for models with unknown normalizing constants or
              missing data. In addition to being used for estimation, our
              method may be useful for setting the parameters of a Bayes prior
              distribution by specifying moments of a distribution using prior
              information. We present two examples---specification of a
              multivariate prior distribution in a constrained-parameter family
              and estimation of parameters in an image model. The former
              example, used for an application in pharmacokinetics, motivated
              this work. This work is similar to Ruppert's method in stochastic
              approximation, combines Monte Carlo simulation and the
              Newton-Raphson algorithm as in Penttinen, uses computational
              ideas and importance sampling identities of Gelfand and Carlin,
              Geyer, and Geyer and Thompson developed for Monte Carlo maximum
              likelihood, and has some similarities to the maximum likelihood

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: The United States health care debate has focused
                 on the nation's uniquely high rates of lack of insurance and
                 poor health outcomes relative to other high-income countries.
                 Large disparities in health outcomes are well-documented in
                 the US, but the most recent assessment of county disparities
                 in mortality is from 1999. It is critical to tracking progress
                 of health reform legislation to have an up-to-date assessment
                 of disparities in life expectancy across counties. US
                 disparities can be seen more clearly in the context of how
                 progress in each county compares to international trends.
                 METHODS: We use newly released mortality data by age, sex, and
                 county for the US from 2000 to 2007 to compute life tables
                 separately for each sex, for all races combined, for whites,
                 and for blacks. We propose, validate, and apply novel methods
                 to estimate recent life tables for small areas to generate
                 up-to-date estimates. Life expectancy rates and changes in
                 life expectancy for counties are compared to the life
                 expectancies across nations in 2000 and 2007. We calculate the
                 number of calendar years behind each county is in 2000 and
                 2007 compared to an international life expectancy time series.
                 RESULTS: Across US counties, life expectancy in 2007 ranged
                 from 65.9 to 81.1 years for men and 73.5 to 86.0 years for
                 women. When compared against a time series of life expectancy
                 in the 10 nations with the lowest mortality, US counties range
                 from being 15 calendar years ahead to over 50 calendar years
                 behind for men and 16 calendar years ahead to over 50 calendar
                 years behind for women. County life expectancy for black men
                 ranges from 59.4 to 77.2 years, with counties ranging from
                 seven to over 50 calendar years behind the international
                 frontier; for black women, the range is 69.6 to 82.6 years,
                 with counties ranging from eight to over 50 calendar years
                 behind. Between 2000 and 2007, 80\% (men) and 91\% (women) of
                 American counties fell in standing against this international
                 life expectancy standard. CONCLUSIONS: The US has extremely
                 large geographic and racial disparities, with some communities
                 having life expectancies already well behind those of the
                 best-performing nations. At the same time, relative
                 performance for most communities continues to drop. Efforts to
                 address these issues will need to tackle the leading
                 preventable causes of death.",

  abstract  = "This paper develops the concepts and methods of a process we
               will call ``alignment of computational models'' or ``docking''
               for short. Alignment is needed to determine whether two models
               can produce the same results, which in turn is the basis for
               critical experiments and for tests of whether one model can
               subsume another. We illustrate our concepts and methods using as
               a target a model of cultural transmission built by Axelrod. For
               comparison we use the Sugarscape model developed by Epstein and
               Axtell. The two models differ in many ways and, to date, have
               been employed with quite different aims. The Axelrod model has
               been used principally for intensive experimentation with
               parameter variation, and includes only one mechanism. In
               contrast, the Sugarscape model has been used primarily to
               generate rich ``artificial histories'', scenarios that display
               stylized facts of interest, such as cultural differentiation
               driven by many different mechansims including resource
               availability, migration, trade, and combat. The Sugarscape model
               was modified so as to reproduce the results of the Axelrod
               cultural model. Among the questions we address are: what does it

               standards of equivalence be statistically evaluated, and how do
               subtle differences in model design affect the results? After
               attaining a ``docking'' of the two models, the richer set of

  title     = "Random multiplicative processes: An elementary tutorial",
  author    = "Redner, S",
  abstract  = "An elementary discussion of the statistical properties of the p
               r o d u c t of N independent random variables is given. The
               motivation is to emphasize the essential differences between the
               asymptotic N→∞ behavior of a random product and the asymptotic
               behavior of a s u m of random variables---a random additive
               process. For this latter process, it is widely appreciated that
               the asymptotic behavior of the sum and its distribution is
               provided by the central limit theorem. However, no such
               universal principle exists for a random multiplicative process.
               In this case, the ratio between the average value of the product
               〈P〉 and the most probable value P mp diverges exponentially in N
               as N→∞. Within a continuum approximation, the classical
               log‐normal form is often invoked to describe the distribution of
               the product. It is shown, however, that the log‐normal provides
               a poor approximation for the asymptotic behavior of the average
               value and, also, for the higher moments of the product. A
               procedure for computing the correct leading asymptotic behavior
               of the moments is outlined. The implications of these results
               for simulations of random multiplicative processes are also
               discussed. For such a simulation, the numerically observed
               ‘‘average’’ value of the product is of the order of P mp, and it
               is only when the simulation is large enough to sample a finite
               fraction of all the states in the system that a monotonic
               crossover to the true average value 〈P〉 occurs. An idealized,
               but quantitative account for this crossover is provided.",

@ARTICLE{Gelman1993-gh,
  title    = "Why are American Presidential Election Campaign Polls so Variable
              when Votes are so Predictable?",
  author   = "Gelman, Andrew and King, Gary",
  abstract = "As most political scientists know, the outcome of the U.S.
              Presidential election can be predicted within a few percentage
              points (in the popular vote), based on information available
              months before the election. Thus, the general election campaign
              for president seems irrelevant to the outcome (except in very
              close elections), despite all the media coverage of campaign
              strategy. However, it is also well known that the pre-election
              opinion polls can vary wildly over the campaign, and this
              variation is generally attributed to events in the campaign. How
              can campaign events affect people’s opinions on whom they plan to
              vote for, and yet not affect the outcome of the election? For
              that matter, why do voters consistently increase their support
              for a candidate during his nominating convention, even though the
              conventions are almost entirely predictable events whose effects
              can be rationally forecast? In this exploratory study, we
              consider several intuitively appealing, but ultimately wrong,
              resolutions to this puzzle, and discuss our current understanding
              of what causes opinion polls to fluctuate and yet reach a
              predictable outcome. Our evidence is based on graphical
              presentation and analysis of over 67,000 individual-level
              responses from forty-nine commercial polls during the 1988
              campaign and many other aggregate poll results from the
              1952--1992 campaigns. We show that responses to pollsters during
              the campaign are not generally informed or even, in a sense we
              describe, ``rational.'' In contrast, voters decide which
              candidate to eventually support based on their enlightened
              preferences, as formed by the information they have learned
              during the campaign, as well as basic political cues such as
              ideology and party identification. We cannot prove this
              conclusion, but we do show that it is consistent with the
              aggregate forecasts and individual-level opinion poll responses.
              Based on the enlightened preferences hypothesis, we conclude that
              the news media have an important effect on the outcome of
              Presidential elections---not due to misleading advertisements,
              sound bites, or spin doctors, but rather by conveying candidates’
              positions on important issues.",

              more central aspect of economic life: working. Although
              workaholism raises some of the same health-related concerns as
              other addictions, compared to most of the more familiar
              addictions it is more likely to be a problem of higher-income
              individuals and is more likely to generate negative spillovers

              History Survey and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we show

              consistent with workaholism with regard to retiring--they are
              more likely to postpone earlier plans for retirement. The theory
              and evidence suggest that the presence of workaholism calls for a
              more progressive income tax system than otherwise, although other

              contribute when few realizations of the process being estimated
              are observed. We show that this argument is incorrect even in the
              extreme situation of estimating the probabilities of events so
              rare that they have never occurred. We show how statistical
              forecasting models allow us to use empirical data to improve
              inferences about the probabilities of these events. Our
              application is estimating the probability that your vote will be
              decisive in a U.S. presidential election, a problem that has been
              studied by political scientists for more than two decades. The
              exact value of this probability is of only minor interest, but
              the number has important implications for understanding the
              optimal allocation of campaign resources, whether states and
              voter groups receive their fair share of attention from
              prospective presidents, and how formal ``rational choice'' models
              of voter behavior might be able to explain why people vote at
              all. We show how the probability of a decisive vote can be
              estimated empirically from state-level forecasts of the
              presidential election and illustrate with the example of 1992.
              Based on generalizations of standard political science
              forecasting models, we estimate the (prospective) probability of
              a single vote being decisive as about 1 in 10 million for close
              national elections such as 1992, varying by about a factor of 10
              among states. Our results support the argument that subjective
              probabilities of many types are best obtained through empirically
              based statistical prediction models rather than solely through
              mathematical reasoning. We discuss the implications of our
              findings for the types of decision analyses used in public choice
              studies.",

  abstract    = "Government intervention in insurance markets is ubiquitous and
                 the theoretical basis for such intervention, based on classic
                 work from the 1970s, has been the problem of adverse
                 selection. Over the last decade, empirical work on selection
                 in insurance markets has gained considerable momentum. This
                 research finds that adverse selection exists in some insurance
                 markets but not in others. And it has uncovered examples of
                 markets that exhibit ``advantageous selection''---a phenomenon
                 not considered by the original theory, and one that has
                 different consequences for equilibrium insurance allocation
                 and optimal public policy than the classical case of adverse
                 selection. Advantageous selection arises when the individuals
                 who are willing to pay the most for insurance are those who
                 are the most risk averse (and so have the lowest expected
                 cost). Indeed, it is natural to think that in many instances
                 individuals who value insurance more may also take action to
                 lower their expected costs: drive more carefully, invest in
                 preventive health care, and so on. Researchers have taken
                 steps toward estimating the welfare consequences of detected
                 selection and of potential public policy interventions. In
                 this essay, we present a graphical framework for analyzing
                 both theoretical and empirical work on selection in insurance
                 markets. This graphical approach provides both a useful and
                 intuitive depiction of the basic theory of selection and its
                 implications for welfare and public policy, as well as a lens

               affect political instability. It classifies polities as

               dimensions: election of the executive, constraints on executive
               decision-making authority, and extent of political
               participation. It hypothesizes that strongly autocratic and
               democratic regimes will exhibit the greatest stability resulting
               from self-enforcing equilibria, whereby the maintenance of a
               polity's institutional structure is in the interest of political
               elites, whether through autocratic or democratic control.
               Institutionally inconsistent regimes (those exhibiting a mix of
               institutional characteristics of both democracy and autocracy)
               lack these self-enforcing characteristics and are expected to be
               shorter-lived. Using a log-logistic duration model, polity
               survival time ratios are estimated. Institutionally consistent

  author   = "Shleifer, Andrei and Vishny, Robert",
  abstract = "Analysts of the recent financial crisis often refer to the role
              of asset ``fire sales'' in depleting the balance sheets of
              financial institutions and aggravating the fragility of the
              financial system. The term ``fire sale'' has been around since
              the nineteenth century to describe firms selling smoke-damaged
              merchandise at cut-rate prices in the aftermath of a fire. But
              what are fire sales in broad financial markets with hundreds of
              participants? As we suggested in a 1992 paper, a fire sale is
              essentially a forced sale of an asset at a dislocated price. The
              asset sale is forced in the sense that the seller cannot pay
              creditors without selling assets. The price is dislocated because
              the highest potential bidders are typically involved in a similar
              activity as the seller, and are therefore themselves indebted and
              cannot borrow more to buy the asset. Indeed, rather than bidding
              for the asset, they might be selling similar assets themselves.
              Assets are then bought by nonspecialists who, knowing that they
              have less expertise with the assets in question, are only willing
              to buy at valuations that are much lower. In this paper, we
              selectively review some of the research on fire sales,
              emphasizing both concepts and supporting evidence. We begin by
              describing our 1992 model of fire sales and the related findings
              in empirical corporate finance. We then show that models of fire
              sales can account for several related phenomena during the recent
              financial crisis, including the contraction of the banking system
              and the failures of arbitrage in financial markets exemplified by
              historically unprecedented differences in prices of very similar
              securities. We then link fire sales to macroeconomics by
              discussing how such dislocations of security prices and the
              reduction in balance sheets of banks can reduce investment and
              output. Finally, we consider how the concept of fire sales can
              help us think about government interventions in financial
              markets, including the evidently successful Federal Reserve
              interventions in 2009. Fire sales are surely not the whole story
              of the financial crisis, but they are a phenomenon that binds
              together many elements of the crisis.",

              into the cloud, the computing platform of interest no longer
              resembles a pizza box or a refrigerator, but a warehouse full of
              computers. These new large datacenters are quite different from
              traditional hosting facilities of earlier times and cannot be
              viewed simply as a collection of co-located servers. Large
              portions of the hardware and software resources in these
              facilities must work in concert to efficiently deliver good
              levels of Internet service performance, something that can only
              be achieved by a holistic approach to their design and
              deployment. In other words, we must treat the datacenter itself
              as one massive warehouse-scale computer (WSC). We describe the
              architecture of WSCs, the main factors influencing their design,
              operation, and cost structure, and the characteristics of their
              software base. We hope it will be useful to architects and
              programmers of today's WSCs, as well as those of future many-core
              platforms which may one day implement the equivalent of today's
              WSCs on a single board.Table of Contents: Introduction /

              alternative assumptions. We find that models currently being used

              one-sixth as large and with private sector employment impacts
              likely to be even smaller. We investigate the sensitivity of our

              relatively precisely measured outcomes in the health and

              multiple measurements of such outcomes at relatively short

              the outcomes have low autocorrelation and budget is limited, it

  abstract    = "While it is well documented that economic expansions provide
                 widespread and immediate financial benefits, the evidence on
                 how an economic downturn affects individual's health behaviors
                 is surprisingly mixed. In this paper, we take a structural
                 approach to investigate the effects of wages and working hours
                 on health behaviors of low-educated persons using variations
                 in wages and hours caused by changes in local economic
                 activity. In the empirical analysis, we adopt a two-sample
                 instrumental variables approach to combine the data on
                 individual health behaviors from the Behavioral Risk Factor
                 Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the National Health Interview
                 Survey (NHIS) with the data on individual employment from the
                 Current Population Survey (CPS). The total sample size of the
                 combined CPS-BRFSS data for the time period of 1984-2005 is
                 967,594, while that of the combined CPS-NHIS data for the time
                 period of 1976-2001 is 364,078. We find that increases in
                 wages caused by economic expansions are associated with
                 greater consumption of cigarettes in the United States. We
                 also find that increases in hours of work caused by economic
                 expansions are associated with more cigarette consumption, but
                 less physical activity and physician visits. More importantly,
                 the evidence suggests that most of such effects associated
                 with changes in hours of work can be attributed to the changes
                 at the extensive margin of employment, meaning the changes in
                 employment status, rather than the changes at the intensive
                 margin, meaning changes in hours of work conditional on being
                 employed. These findings imply that changes in employment may
                 have heterogeneous impacts on time-intensive and less
                 time-intensive health behaviors and also provide additional
                 evidence on the importance of time in health production,
                 particularly for time-intensive activities.",

                 effect with constant variance, the optimal design divides the
                 units equally between the two extremes of the design space. If
                 the dose-response relation may be nonlinear, however,
                 intermediate measurements may be useful in order to estimate
                 the effects of partial treatments. We consider the decision of
                 whether to gather data at an intermediate design point: do the
                 gains from learning about nonlinearity outweigh the loss in
                 efficiency in estimating the linear effect? Under reasonable
                 assumptions about nonlinearity, we find that, unless sample
                 size is very large, the design with no interior measurements
                 is best, because with moderate total sample sizes, any
                 nonlinearity in the dose-response will be difficult to detect.

  abstract    = "OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of death associated with various
                 patterns of alcohol consumption. DESIGN: Prospective study of
                 mortality in relation to alcohol drinking habits in 1978, with
                 causes of death sought over the next 13 years (to 1991).
                 SUBJECTS: 12,321 British male doctors born between 1900 and
                 1930 (mean 1916) who replied to a postal questionnaire in
                 1978. Those written to in 1978 were the survivors of a long
                 running prospective study of the effects of smoking that had
                 begun in 1951 and was still continuing. RESULTS: Men were
                 divided on the basis of their response to the 1978
                 questionnaire into two groups according to whether or not they
                 had ever had any type of vascular disease, diabetes, or ``life
                 threatening disease'' and into seven groups according to the
                 amount of alcohol they drank. By 1991 almost a third had died.
                 All statistical analyses of mortality were standardised for
                 age, calendar year, and smoking habit. There was a U shaped
                 relation between all cause mortality and the average amount of
                 alcohol reportedly drunk; those who reported drinking 8-14
                 units of alcohol a week (corresponding to an average of one to
                 two units a day) had the lowest risks. The causes of death
                 were grouped into three main categories: ``alcohol augmented''
                 causes (6\% of all deaths: cirrhosis, liver cancer, upper
                 aerodigestive (mouth, oesophagus, larynx, and pharynx) cancer,
                 alcoholism, poisoning, or injury), ischaemic heart disease
                 (33\% of all deaths), and other causes. The few deaths from
                 alcohol augmented causes showed, at least among regular
                 drinkers, a progressive trend, with the risk increasing with
                 dose. In contrast, the many deaths from ischaemic heart
                 disease showed no significant trend among regular drinkers,
                 but there were significantly lower rates in regular drinkers
                 than in non-drinkers. The aggregate of all other causes showed
                 a U shaped dose-response relation similar to that for all
                 cause mortality. Similar differences persisted irrespective of
                 a history of previous disease, age (under 75 or 75 and older),
                 and period of follow up (first five and last eight years).
                 Some, but apparently not much, of the excess mortality in
                 non-drinkers could be attributed to the inclusion among them
                 of a small proportion of former drinkers. CONCLUSION: The
                 consumption of alcohol appeared to reduce the risk of
                 ischaemic heart disease, largely irrespective of amount. Among
                 regular drinkers mortality from all causes combined increased
                 progressively with amount drunk above 21 units a week. Among
                 British men in middle or older age the consumption of an
                 average of one or two units of alcohol a day is associated
                 with significantly lower all cause mortality than is the
                 consumption of no alcohol, or the consumption of substantial
                 amounts. Above about three units (two American units) of
                 alcohol a day, progressively greater levels of consumption are
                 associated with progressively higher all cause mortality.",

              statistical inferences in settings that would seem to require
              multiple comparisons adjustments. We challenge the Type I error
              paradigm that underlies these corrections. Moreover we posit that
              the problem of multiple comparisons can disappear entirely when
              viewed from a hierarchical Bayesian perspective. We propose
              building multilevel models in the settings where multiple
              comparisons arise. Multilevel models perform partial pooling
              (shifting estimates toward each other), whereas classical
              procedures typically keep the centers of intervals stationary,
              adjusting for multiple comparisons by making the intervals wider
              (or, equivalently, adjusting the p values corresponding to
              intervals of fixed width). Thus, multilevel models address the
              multiple comparisons problem and also yield more efficient
              estimates, especially in settings with low group-level variation,

  author   = "Peksen, Dursun",
  abstract = "This article examines the effect of foreign armed intervention on
              human rights conditions in target countries. It is argued that
              military intervention contributes to the rise of state repression
              by enhancing the state’s coercive power and encouraging more
              repressive behavior, especially when it is supportive or neutral
              toward the target government. Results from bivariate probit
              models estimated on time-series cross-section data show that
              supportive and neutral interventions increase the likelihood of
              extrajudicial killing, disappearance, political imprisonment, and
              torture. Hostile interventions increase only the probability of
              political imprisonment. The involvement of an intergovernmental
              organization or a liberal democracy as an intervener is unlikely
              to make any major difference in the suggested negative impact of

  abstract = "Explained variance (R2) is a familiar summary of the fit of a
              linear regression and has been generalized in various ways to
              multilevel (hierarchical) models. The multilevel models that we
              consider in this article are characterized by hierarchical data
              structures in which individuals are grouped into units (which
              themselves might be further grouped into larger units), and
              variables are measured on individuals and each grouping unit. The
              models are based on regression relationships at different levels,
              with the first level corresponding to the individual data and
              subsequent levels corresponding to between-group regressions of
              individual predictor effects on grouping unit variables. We
              present an approach to defining R2 at each level of the
              multilevel model, rather than attempting to create a single
              summary measure of fit. Our method is based on comparing
              variances in a single fitted model rather than with a null model.
              In simple regression, our measure generalizes the classical
              adjusted R2. We also discuss a related variance comparison to
              summarize the degree to which estimates at each level of the
              model are pooled together based on the level-specific regression
              relationship, rather than estimated separately. This pooling
              factor is related to the concept of shrinkage in simple
              hierarchical models. We illustrate the methods on a dataset of
              radon in houses within counties using a series of models ranging
              from a simple linear regression model to a multilevel

  abstract = "Many experts consider nuclear terrorism the single greatest
              threat to U.S. security. The fear that a state might transfer
              nuclear materials to terrorists was a core justification for the
              invasion of Iraq in 2003 and, more recently, for a strike against
              Iran's nuclear program. The logical basis for this concern is
              sound: if a state could orchestrate an anonymous nuclear terror
              attack, it could destroy an enemy yet avoid retaliation. But how
              likely is it that the perpetrators of nuclear terrorism could
              remain anonymous? Data culled from a decade of terrorist
              incidents reveal that attribution is very likely after
              high-casualty terror attacks. Attribution rates are even higher
              for attacks on the U.S. homeland or the territory of a major U.S.
              ally---97 percent for incidents in which ten or more people were
              killed. Moreover, tracing a terrorist group that used a nuclear
              weapon to its state sponsor would not be difficult, because few
              countries sponsor terror; few terror groups have multiple
              sponsors; and only one country that sponsors terrorism, Pakistan,
              has nuclear weapons or enough material to manufacture them. If
              leaders understand these facts, they will be as reluctant to give
              weapons to terrorists as they are to use them directly; both
              actions would invite devastating retaliation.",

              1960. Yet while civil war is central to many nations'
              development, it has stood at the periphery of economics research
              and teaching. The past decade has witnessed a long overdue
              explosion of research into war's causes and consequences. We
              summarize progress, identify weaknesses, and chart a path
              forward. Why war? Existing theory is provocative but incomplete,
              omitting advances in behavioral economics and making little
              progress in key areas, like why armed groups form and cohere, or
              how more than two armed sides compete. Empirical work finds that
              low per capita incomes and slow economic growth are both robustly
              linked to civil war. Yet there is little consensus on the most
              effective policies to avert conflicts or promote postwar
              recovery. Cross-country analysis of war will benefit from more
              attention to causal identification and stronger links to theory.
              We argue that micro-level analysis and case studies are also
              crucial to decipher war's causes, conduct, and consequences. We
              bring a growth theoretic approach to the study of conflict
              consequences to highlight areas for research, most of all the
              study of war's impact on institutions. We conclude with a plea

              that meet periodically to consider a series of binary decisions.
              Each member is allocated a fixed budget of votes to be cast as
              desired over the sequence of decisions. This provides incentives
              for voters to spend more votes on those decisions that matter to
              them more, typically generating welfare gains over standard
              majority voting with non-storable votes. Equilibrium strategies
              have a very intuitive feature---the number of votes cast must be
              monotonic in the voter's intensity of preferences---but are
              otherwise difficult to calculate, raising questions of practical
              implementation. We present experimental data where realized

  abstract = "This article examines some claims made in a recent popular book
              of political sociology, with the intent not being to debunk any
              claims but rather to connect some important social and policy
              positions to statistical data on income, social class, and
              political attitudes. The thesis of Charles Murray’s book is that
              America’s upper and lower classes have become increasingly
              separate, with elites living more disciplined, orderly lives
              (characterized by marriage, work, and stable families) while
              being largely unaware of the lifestyles of the majority of
              Americans. I argue that some of Murray’s conclusions are
              sensitive to particular choices of whom to label as elite or
              upper-class. From my analysis of survey data, I see the big
              culture war occurring within the upper class, whereas Murray
              focuses on differences in attitudes and lifestyles comparing rich
              to poor. Coming Apart is a lively contribution to current debates
              and complements more statistical analyses of political and social

               and abroad. A country's deterrence decision involves both
               external benefits and costs as the terrorist threat is
               deflected, while its preemption decision typically gives
               external benefits when the threat is reduced for all potential
               targets. With damages limited to home interests, a country will
               overdeter, while, for globalized terror, a country will
               underdeter. Pre-emption is usually undersupplied.
               Leader-follower behaviour is apt to lessen inefficiency for
               deterrence, but worsen inefficiency for pre-emption, compared
               with simultaneous-choice equilibrium allocations. Targeted

                 behavioral economics that raises questions about its
                 usefulness in public policy analysis. What happiness
                 economists call ``habituation'' refers to the fact that
                 people's reported well-being reverts to a base level, even
                 after major life events such as a disabling injury or winning
                 the lottery. What behavioral economists call ``projection
                 bias'' refers to the fact that people systematically mistake
                 current circumstances for permanence, buying too much food if
                 shopping while hungry for example. Habituation means happiness
                 does not react to long-term changes, and projection bias means
                 happiness over-reacts to temporary changes. I demonstrate this
                 outcome by combining responses to happiness questions with
                 information about air quality and weather on the day and in
                 the place where those questions were asked. The current day's
                 air quality affects happiness while the local annual average
                 does not. Interpreted literally, either the value of air
                 quality is not measurable using the happiness approach or air
                 quality has no value. Interpreted more generously, projection
                 bias saves happiness economics from habituation, enabling its
                 use in public policy.",

  abstract    = "Online journals promise to serve more information to more
                 dispersed audiences and are more efficiently searched and
                 recalled. But because they are used differently than
                 print-scientists and scholars tend to search electronically
                 and follow hyperlinks rather than browse or
                 peruse-electronically available journals may portend an ironic
                 change for science. Using a database of 34 million articles,
                 their citations (1945 to 2005), and online availability (1998
                 to 2005), I show that as more journal issues came online, the
                 articles referenced tended to be more recent, fewer journals
                 and articles were cited, and more of those citations were to
                 fewer journals and articles. The forced browsing of print
                 archives may have stretched scientists and scholars to anchor
                 findings deeply into past and present scholarship. Searching
                 online is more efficient and following hyperlinks quickly puts
                 researchers in touch with prevailing opinion, but this may
                 accelerate consensus and narrow the range of findings and

  abstract = "The financial crisis of 2007 to 2009 can be divided into two
              distinct phases. The first and more limited phase from August
              2007 to August 2008 stemmed from losses in one relatively small
              segment of the U.S. financial system---namely, subprime
              residential mortgages. Despite this disruption to financial
              markets, real GDP in the United States continued to rise into the
              second quarter of 2008, and forecasters were predicting only a
              mild recession. In mid-September 2008, however, the financial
              crisis entered a far more virulent phase. In rapid succession,
              the investment bank Lehman Brothers entered bankruptcy on
              September 15, 2008; the insurance firm AIG collapsed on September
              16, 2008; there was a run on the Reserve Primary Fund money
              market fund on the same day; and the highly publicized struggle
              to pass the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) began. How did
              something that appeared in mid-2008 to be a significant but
              fairly mild financial disruption transform into a full-fledged
              global financial crisis? What caused this transformation? Did the
              government responses to the global financial crisis help avoid a
              worldwide depression? What challenges do these government
              interventions raise for the world financial system and the
              economy going forward?",

                 networks, human mobility and dynamical processes such as
                 epidemic spreading. Here we analyze data on the time-resolved
                 face-to-face proximity of individuals in large-scale
                 real-world scenarios. We compare two settings with very
                 different properties, a scientific conference and a
                 long-running museum exhibition. We track the behavioral
                 networks of face-to-face proximity, and characterize them from
                 both a static and a dynamic point of view, exposing
                 differences and similarities. We use our data to investigate
                 the dynamics of a susceptible-infected model for epidemic
                 spreading that unfolds on the dynamical networks of human
                 proximity. The spreading patterns are markedly different for
                 the conference and the museum case, and they are strongly
                 impacted by the causal structure of the network data. A deeper
                 study of the spreading paths shows that the mere knowledge of
                 static aggregated networks would lead to erroneous conclusions

               Innovative methods developed here include (1) the use of results
               from a previous hierarchical statistical analysis to obtain
               probability distributions with local variation in both
               predictions and uncertainties, (2) graphical methods to display

               alternative parameterizations for individual variation in the

               cost-benefit analyses for a variety of decision strategies, as a

               is decisive-is affected by the rule for aggregating votes into a
               single outcome. Voting power is important for studying political
               representation, fairness and strategy, and has been much
               discussed in political science. Although power indexes are often
               considered as mathematical definitions, they ultimately depend
               on statistical models of voting. Mathematical calculations of
               voting power usually have been performed under the model that
               votes are decided by coin flips. This simple model has
               interesting implications for weighted elections, two-stage
               elections (such as the U.S. Electoral College) and coalition
               structures. We discuss empirical failings of the coin-flip model
               of voting and consider, first, the implications for voting power
               and, second, ways in which votes could be modeled more
               realistically. Under the random voting model, the standard
               deviation of the average of n votes is proportional to
               $1/\textbackslash{}sqrt n$, but under more general models, this
               variance can have the form cn-$\alpha$ or
               $\textbackslash{}sqrt\{a\textbackslash{};-\textbackslash{};b\textbackslash{};log\textbackslash{};n\}$.

  abstract    = "In the United States and abroad, the aging of the population
                 and changes in its demographic and social composition raise
                 important considerations for the future of health care and the
                 systems that pay for care. Studies in the United States on
                 end-of-life expenditures and utilization focus primarily on
                 Medicare and have reported differences in formal end-of-life
                 spending and types of services used by age, race, gender, and
                 other personal characteristics, with most notable differences
                 attributed to age at death. Although overall health care
                 spending tends to be higher for people who are white and
                 women, these patterns tend to either reverse themselves or
                 narrow at the end of life. However, age at death continues to
                 be associated with large spending differences at the end of
                 life, with end-of-life spending declining at older ages.
                 Although different data sources, analytic methods, and
                 definitions of end-of-life care make comparisons of the
                 absolute level of end-of-life spending in the United States to
                 that of other countries difficult, a reading of the existing
                 literature reveals some similarities in the distribution of
                 spending across patient characteristics, even across different
                 systems of health care and insurance. In particular,
                 end-of-life spending tends to decline with age, indicating
                 that treatment intensity likely declines with age in most
                 countries to varying degrees. Future international
                 collaborations may help to make data collection and analysis

              Recent statistical advances present social scientists with new

              guidelines for learning about various network processes using ARD
              and a template to aid practitioners. We first propose that ARD
              can be used to measure ``social distance'' between a respondent
              and a subpopulation (individuals named Kevin, those in prison, or
              those serving in the military). We then present common methods
              for analyzing these data and associate each of these methods with
              a specific way of measuring social distance, thus associating
              statistical tools with their underlying social science phenomena.
              We examine the implications of using each of these social
              distance measures using an Internet survey about contemporary
              political issues.",

               Before World War I, it instituted workers' compensation, old age
               pensions, health insurance, and the world's first compulsory
               system of unemployment insurance. By the end of the nineteenth
               century, the United States had expanded Civil War pensions into
               de facto old age and disability pensions for many working- and
               middle-class Americans. However, during the Progressive Era, as
               the Civil War generation died off, the United States failed to
               institute modern pensions and social insurance. Conventional
               theories of welfare-state development-theories emphasizing
               industrialization, liberal values, and demands by the organized
               industrial working class-cannot sufficiently account for these
               contrasting British and U.S. patterns. Instead, a macropolitical
               explanation is developed. By the early twentieth century,
               Britain had a strong civil service and competing,
               programmatically oriented political parties. Patronage politics
               had been overcome, and political leaders and social elites were
               willing to use social spending as a way to appeal to
               working-class voters. However, the contemporary United States
               lacked an established civil bureaucracy and was embroiled in the
               efforts of Progressive reformers to create regulatory agencies
               and policies free of the ``political corruption'' of
               nineteenth-century patronage democracy. Modern social-spending

  abstract    = "The evolution of cooperation has a well established
                 theoretical framework based on game theory. This approach has
                 made valuable contributions to a wide variety of disciplines,
                 including political science, economics, and evolutionary
                 biology. Existing cancer theory suggests that individual
                 clones of cancer cells evolve independently from one another,
                 acquiring all of the genetic traits or hallmarks necessary to
                 form a malignant tumor. It is also now recognized that tumors
                 are heterotypic, with cancer cells interacting with normal
                 stromal cells within the tissue microenvironment, including
                 endothelial, stromal, and nerve cells. This tumor cell-stromal
                 cell interaction in itself is a form of commensalism, because
                 it has been demonstrated that these nonmalignant cells support
                 and even enable tumor growth. Here, we add to this theory by
                 regarding tumor cells as game players whose interactions help
                 to determine their Darwinian fitness. We marshal evidence that
                 tumor cells overcome certain host defenses by means of
                 diffusible products. Our original contribution is to raise the
                 possibility that two nearby cells can protect each other from
                 a set of host defenses that neither could survive alone.
                 Cooperation can evolve as by-product mutualism among
                 genetically diverse tumor cells. Our hypothesis supplements,
                 but does not supplant, the traditional view of carcinogenesis
                 in which one clonal population of cells develops all of the
                 necessary genetic traits independently to form a tumor.
                 Cooperation through the sharing of diffusible products raises
                 new questions about tumorigenesis and has implications for
                 understanding observed phenomena, designing new experiments,
                 and developing new therapeutic approaches.",

                 concentration and measurement is nonlinear and
                 heteroscedastic, and so it is not appropriate to weight these
                 measurements equally. In the standard existing approach for
                 analysis of these data, a large proportion of the measurements
                 are discarded as being above or below detection limits. We
                 present a Bayesian method for jointly estimating the
                 calibration curve and the unknown concentrations using all the
                 data. Compared to the existing method, our estimates have much
                 lower standard errors and give estimates even when all the

                 our method empirically using laboratory data on cockroach

                 much more accurate than those obtained using the usual
                 approach. In addition, we develop a method for determining the
                 ``effective weight'' attached to each measurement, based on a
                 local linearization of the estimated model. The effective
                 weight can give insight into the information conveyed by each

               analyses are often conditional; the magnitudes of relationships
               frequently change among different types of people, and in
               different contexts. A common practice in studying such
               relationships has been to calculate and compare correlation
               coefficients, or other standardized measures of association,
               among subsets of observations defined by the conditioning
               variable. This method is criticized, and in its place we
               advocate a general linear model approach to assessing the extent
               of change in relationships among groups of observations. The
               approach consists of comparing a series of linear regression
               models with three criteria being offered for evaluating
               differences among the models. The analysis strategy is then

  author    = "Pang, Andr\'{e} T H and Chakravarty, Manuel M T",
  abstract  = "The interfacing of object-oriented languages with functional
               languages, in general, and with Haskell, in particular, has
               received a considerable amount of attention. Previous work,
               including Lambada, a Haskell to Java bridge, showed how an
               object-oriented class hierarchy can be modeled using Haskell
               type classes, such that Java libraries can be used conveniently
               from Haskell. The present paper extends this previous work in
               two major directions. Firstly, we describe a new implementation
               of object-oriented style method calls and overloading in
               Haskell, using multi-parameter type classes and functional
               dependencies. This enables calling of a foreign object’s methods
               in a syntactically convenient, type-safe manner. Secondly, we
               sketch an approach to automating the generation of library
               bindings using compile-time meta-programming for object-oriented
               frameworks featuring reflection. We have evaluated the
               practicality of our approach by implementing a Haskell binding
               to the Objective-C language on the Mac OS X platform.",

  author    = "Atran, Scott and Axelrod, Robert",
  abstract  = "Sacred values differ from material or instrumental values in
               that they incorporate moral beliefs that drive action in ways
               dissociated from prospects for success. Across the world, people
               believe that devotion to essential or core values --- such as
               the welfare of their family and country, or their commitment to
               religion, honor, and justice --- are, or ought to be, absolute
               and inviolable. Counterintuitively, understanding an opponent's
               sacred values, we believe, offers surprising opportunities for
               breakthroughs to peace. Because of the emotional unwillingness
               of those in conflict situations to negotiate sacred values,
               conventional wisdom suggests that negotiators should either
               leave sacred values for last in political negotiations or should
               try to bypass them with sufficient material incentives. Our
               empirical findings and historical analysis suggest that
               conventional wisdom is wrong. In fact, offering to provide
               material benefits in exchange for giving up a sacred value
               actually makes settlement more difficult because people see the
               offering as an insult rather than a compromise. But we also
               found that making symbolic concessions of no apparent material
               benefit might open the way to resolving seemingly irresolvable
               conflicts. We offer suggestions for how negotiators can reframe
               their position by demonstrating respect and/or by apologizing
               for what they sincerely regret. We also offer suggestions for
               how to overcome barriers by refining sacred values to exclude
               outmoded claims, exploiting the inevitable ambiguity of sacred
               values, shifting the context, provisionally prioritizing values,
               and reframing responsibility.",

  abstract = "The observed dramatic decrease in September sea ice extent (SIE)
              has been widely discussed in the scientific literature. Though
              there is qualitative agreement between observations and ensemble
              members of the Third Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
              (CMIP3), it is concerning that the observed trend (1979--2010) is
              not captured by any ensemble member. The potential sources of
              this discrepancy include: observational uncertainty, physical
              model limitations and vigorous natural climate variability. The
              latter has received less attention and is difficult to assess
              using the relatively short observational sea ice records. In this
              study multi-centennial pre-industrial control simulations with
              five CMIP3 climate models are used to investigate the role that
              the Arctic oscillation (AO), the Atlantic multi-decadal
              oscillation (AMO) and the Atlantic meridional overturning
              circulation (AMOC) play in decadal sea ice variability. Further,
              we use the models to determine the impact that these sources of
              variability have had on SIE over both the era of satellite
              observation (1979--2010) and an extended observational record
              (1953--2010). There is little evidence of a relationship between
              the AO and SIE in the models. However, we find that both the AMO
              and AMOC indices are significantly correlated with SIE in all the
              models considered. Using sensitivity statistics derived from the
              models, assuming a linear relationship, we attribute
              0.5--3.1\%/decade of the 10.1\%/decade decline in September SIE
              (1979--2010) to AMO driven variability.",

              Such schemes inevitably generate a residual profit, and a
              property right to the residual creates a stake in inefficiency;
              the residual can be increased by a distortion of the efficient
              incentive system. In general, therefore, the residual-owners'
              claims that they will not distort the efficient incentive scheme
              are not credible. Economic efficiency in the presence of
              externalities requires the resolution of a fundamentally

                 for the same prescription drugs because each agency uses a

                 not identify any economic rationale or socially accepted moral
                 reasoning that would justify the current level of price
                 variation, we suggest that the federal government should pay a
                 uniform price for each drug. Laws and regulations that give
                 certain federal agencies the ability to earn rebates, use
                 formularies, or permit other special arrangements would need
                 to be eliminated in order to have a single payment rate. This
                 could make some government agencies worse off than others;
                 however, a uniform payment rate would not need to affect
                 beneficiaries' current financial contributions, access to
                 drugs, benefits or overall public expenditures. At the same
                 time, having a single rate would permit the government to
                 adopt a more effective approach to purchasing drugs and send a
                 consistent message to pharmaceutical companies concerning
                 which types of drugs the government wants them to develop for
                 government beneficiaries. How this single price would be
                 derived and how it would compare with the lowest or highest
                 prices currently achieved by government agencies would depend
                 on a variety of policy issues including the government's

               cooperation in particular has been beneficially influenced by
               the Prisoners' Dilemma (PD) game model, but there is a mistaken
               tendency to treat PD as representing the singular problem of
               collective action and cooperation. By relaxing the assumptions
               of 2 x 2 games and developing an alternate model of the
               coordination game, I show how some cooperation problems have
               very different properties from those found in PD. The analytical
               results of the two games are compared across several important
               dimensions: number of strategies available, number of iterations
               of the game, numbers of players, and the distribution of power
               among them. The discussion is illustrated with specific problems
               of international cooperation, and the implications of
               alternative cooperation problems for the formation and
               performance of international regimes are explored. The basic
               solutions for PD and coordination have divergent ramifications
               for the institutionalization, stability, and adaptability of
               regimes and for the role of hegemony in the international
               system. However, the coordination model does not replace the PD
               model but complements and supplements it as a way to understand
               the diversity of political institutions. These results are

              supporters, but these groups may have very different political
              attitudes and priorities. This paper explores the resulting
              strategic tensions in the context of the contemporary American
              party system. Starting from a model of utility maximization by
              party elites, I derive weights characterizing the value to each
              party of potential swing voters and core supporters. I use data
              from American National Election Study surveys conducted in six
              presidential elections (1988-2008) to identify swing voters and
              core partisans and to characterize their attitudes on four
              political dimensions---Social Welfare Conservatism, Moral
              Conservatism, Racial Conservatism, and Anti-Government Attitudes.
              I also estimate the relative intensity of the attitudes of swing
              voters, the Republican base, and the Democratic base in each of
              these four domains. My statistical results suggest that
              Republican core partisans have cared much more about race and
              morality than swing voters have, and much less about social
              welfare. Democratic core partisans, in contrast, have cared
              strongly about social welfare but remarkably little about
              morality or race. These differences in the relative intensity of
              preferences should have important implications for the nature of
              political compromises between swing voters and core partisans.
              However, an analysis of the perceived stands of Republican and
              Democratic presidential candidates provides no evidence that they
              do, and suggests that Democratic candidates, especially, have
              generally been more extreme than can plausibly be accounted for
              on the basis of the compromises posited here between the views of
              swing voters and core partisans.",

              respondent's assessment of whether it is a citizen's duty to vote
              on referendums adds substantial explanatory power to a basic
              model of turnout. From here we move to examine what drives that

              evaluations of politics and politicians. Low interest in
              politics, low political efficacy, and low regard for politicians
              correspond with less support for the idea that citizens have a

  abstract = "Many theorists argue that deliberation helps citizens become more
              informed, but to what degree does discussion affect actual levels
              of political knowledge? I examine the potential for enlightenment
              through political discussion by replicating and extending Jeffery
              J. Mondak’s (2000) article in Political Analysis, and then
              cross-validating his study through similar analyses with a new
              data set. Mondak demonstrated that political discussion in the
              1992 National Election Studies survey reduced the proportion of
              ``don’t know'' responses relative to the proportion of correct
              answers. My analysis using the same grouped-data multinomial
              logit model on the same data produces identical results. I obtain
              similar results in an extension of his 1992 NES analysis when I
              include 215 cases that were excluded; the direction and
              statistical significance remain the same, but small differences
              in the magnitude of specific coefficients and their standard
              errors are observed. A third investigation generates a comparable
              pattern of increased proportions of correct knowledge relative to
              the ``don’t know'' responses in two cross-sectional surveys
              conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates in 1998. Taken
              together, these analyses reveal that discussion increases
              political knowledge, but it does so selectively. While
              grouped-data multinomial logit models may be used in this manner
              to detect subtle differences in forms of information, they still
              might not be a solution to the fundamental validity problem
              plaguing studies of political knowledge.",

               an additional source of information in the facial perception of
               emotions. The paper analyses experimental data on the perception
               of emotion to investigate whether there is evidence for
               configural encoding in the processing of facial expressions. It
               is argued that analysis with a probabilistic feature model has
               several advantages that are not implied by, for example, a
               generalized linear modelling approach. First, the probabilistic
               feature model allows us to extract empirically the facial
               features that are relevant in processing the face, rather than
               focusing on the features that were manipulated in the
               experiment. Second, the probabilistic feature model allows a
               direct test of the hypothesis of configural encoding as it
               explicitly formalizes a mechanism for the way in which
               information about separate facial features is combined in
               processing the face. Third, the model allows us to account for a
               complex data structure while still yielding parameters that have
               a straightforward interpretation.",

  author      = "Ishiyama, John and Balarezo, Christine A and Miles, Tom",
  abstract    = "As part of a continuing project on the structure of graduate
                 education programs in political science, in this paper we
                 investigate whether the existence of a required graduate
                 course on -Teaching in Political Science‖ and/or -professional
                 socialization‖ is related to the overall job placement rates.
                 To be sure there have been several recent noteworthy studies
                 that have examined Ph.D. placement rates (such as Fowler,
                 Grofman and Masuoka 2007; Masuoka, Grofman, and Feld 2007),
                 these studies have examined only placement rates at Ph.D.
                 granting institutions as opposed to placements at all
                 institutions, including non Ph.D. granting programs. Given
                 that the Carnegie Foundation has noted the largest proportion
                 of political scientists are employed at Non Ph.D. granting
                 departments (which often very much value teaching skills and
                 look for these skills in recruiting faculty) it might be
                 expected that offering a required course on teaching would
                 increase the overall probability of placement, ceteris
                 paribus. In a previous study (Ishiyama, Miles and Balarezo,
                 forthcoming) we collected data on whether Ph.D. granting
                 departments overtly prepares their graduates for teaching (by
                 offering a dedicated course that trains future professionals
                 as teachers) in the profession. Combining this original data
                 set with data from the APSA on placements in political science
                 will allow the empirical examination of whether or not such
                 teacher training programs/courses in political science

                 representative national samples of children in 1984 and 1992.
                 The CogAT norm comparisons indicate shifts in IQ levels
                 consistent with the blood lead to IQ relationship reported by
                 an earlier study and population shifts in average blood lead
                 for children under age 6 between 1976 and 1991. The CogAT norm
                 comparisons also support studies indicating that the IQ to
                 blood lead slope may increase at lower blood lead levels.
                 Furthermore, long-term trends in population exposure to
                 gasoline lead were found to be remarkably consistent with
                 subsequent changes in violent crime and unwed pregnancy.
                 Long-term trends in paint and gasoline lead exposure are also
                 strongly associated with subsequent trends in murder rates
                 going back to 1900. The findings on violent crime and unwed
                 pregnancy are consistent with published data describing the
                 relationship between IQ and social behavior. The findings with
                 respect to violent crime are also consistent with studies
                 indicating that children with higher bone lead tend to display
                 more aggressive and delinquent behavior. This analysis

                 historical importance; however, with increasing reports of
                 incidence and the discovery of antibiotic-resistant strains of
                 the plague bacterium Yersinia pestis, it is re-emerging as a
                 significant health concerns. Here we bypass the conventional
                 human-disease models, and propose that bubonic plague is
                 driven by the dynamics of the disease in the rat population.
                 Using a stochastic, spatial metapopulation model, we show that
                 bubonic plague can persist in relatively small rodent
                 populations from which occasional human epidemics arise,
                 without the need for external imports. This explains why
                 historically the plague persisted despite long disease-free
                 periods, and how the disease re-occurred in cities with tight
                 quarantine control. In a contemporary setting, we show that
                 human vaccination cannot eradicate the plague, and that
                 culling of rats may prevent or exacerbate human epidemics,
                 depending on the timing of the cull. The existence of plague
                 reservoirs in wild rodent populations has important
                 public-health implications for the transmission to urban rats
                 and the subsequent risk of human outbreaks.",

                 inequalities in life expectancy at birth and other ages in the
                 United States between 1980 and 2000 by gender and
                 socioeconomic deprivation levels. METHODS: A factor-based
                 deprivation index consisting of 11 education, occupation,
                 wealth, income distribution, unemployment, poverty, and
                 housing quality indicators was used to define deprivation
                 deciles, which were then linked to the US mortality data at
                 the county-level. Life expectancy estimates were developed by
                 age, gender, and deprivation levels for three 3 year time
                 periods: 1980-82, 1989-91, and 1998-2000. Inequalities in life
                 expectancy were measured by the absolute difference between
                 the least-deprived group and each of the other deprivation
                 deciles. Slope indices of inequality for each gender and time
                 period were calculated by regressing life expectancy estimates
                 on deprivation levels using weighted least squares models.
                 RESULTS: Those in less-deprived groups experienced a longer
                 life expectancy at each age than their counterparts in
                 more-deprived groups. In 1980-82, the overall life expectancy
                 at birth was 2.8 years longer for the least-deprived group
                 than for the most-deprived group (75.8 vs 73.0 years). By
                 1998-2000, the absolute difference in life expectancy at birth
                 had increased to 4.5 years (79.2 vs 74.7 years). The
                 inequality indices also showed a substantial widening of the
                 deprivation gradient in life expectancy during the study
                 period for both males and females. CONCLUSIONS: Between 1980
                 and 2000, those in higher socioeconomic groups experienced
                 larger gains in life expectancy than those in more-deprived
                 groups, contributing to the widening gap.",

  title    = "Systemic Consequences of Incumbency Advantage in the {U.S}. House",
  author   = "King, Gary and Gelman, Andrew",
  abstract = "The dramatic increase in the electoral advantage of incumbency
              has sparked widespread interest among congressional researchers
              over the last 15 years. Although many scholars have studied the
              advantages of incumbency for incumbents, few have analyzed its
              effects on the underlying electoral system. We examine the
              influence of the incumbency advantage on two features of the
              electoral system in the U.S. House elections: electoral
              responsiveness and partisan bias. Using a district-level
              seats-votes model of House elections, we are able to distinguish
              systematic changes from unique, election-specific variations. Our
              results confirm the significant drop in responsiveness, and even
              steeper decline outside the South, over the past 40 years.
              Contrary to expectations, we find that increased incumbency
              advantage explains less than a third of this trend, indicating
              that some other unknown factor is responsible. Moreover, our
              analysis also reveals another dramatic pattern, largely
              overlooked in the congressional literature: in the 1940’s and
              1950’s the electoral system was severely biased in favor of the
              Republican party. The system shifted incrementally from this
              severe Republican bias over the next several decades to a
              moderate Democratic bias by the mid-1980’s. Interestingly,
              changes in incumbency advantage explain virtually all of this
              trend in partisan bias since the 1940’s. By removing incumbency
              advantage and the existing configuration of incumbents and
              challengers analytically, our analysis reveals an underlying
              electoral system that remains consistently biased in favor of the
              Republican party. Thus, our results indicate that incumbency
              advantage affects the underlying electoral system, but contrary
              to conventional wisdom, this changes the trend in partisan bias
              more than electoral responsiveness.",

              informal borrowing. We define network-based trust as the largest
              amount one agent can borrow from another agent and derive a
              reduced-form expression for this quantity, which we then use in
              three applications. (1) We predict that dense networks generate
              bonding social capital that allows transacting valuable assets,
              whereas loose networks create bridging social capital that
              improves access to cheap favors such as information. (2) For job
              recommendation networks, we show that strong ties between
              employers and trusted recommenders reduce asymmetric information
              about the quality of job candidates. (3) Using data from Peru, we
              show empirically that network-based trust predicts informal
              borrowing, and we structurally estimate and test our model.",

              explore how domestic and international audiences shape the
              combatants' preferences for mediation. With regard to domestic
              pressures, combatants often desire mediation as political cover
              for unpalatable concessions. That is, intermediaries might
              obscure responsibility for disappointing outcomes or signal the
              prudence of compromise. In terms of international audiences,
              aected third parties eager to shape the resolution outcome might
              lobby to serve as a mediator. Since both domestic and
              international audiences are aected by the crisis severity, the
              article also explores how the pain of fighting conditions the
              effect of international and domestic political pressures.
              Empirical analysis of international crises since World War I
              confirms that potential domestic audience costs for seeking peace
              and the propensity for concessions positively aect the
              probability of mediation. Less clear is the role of third-party
              incentives; the results indicate that a higher potential for
              neighboring-state intervention actually decreases the likelihood
              of mediation. Consistent with previous studies, conflict costs
              increase mediation incidence, and the ndings also indicate that
              at high costs of conflict states appear in less need of political
              cover for making concessions."

  abstract = "Despite widespread recognition that aggregated summary statistics
              on international conflict and cooperation miss most of the
              complex interactions among nations, the vast majority of scholars
              continue to employ annual, quarterly, or occasionally monthly
              observations. Daily events data, coded from some of the huge
              volume of news stories produced by journalists, have not been
              used much for the last two decades. We offer some reason to
              change this practice, which we feel should lead to considerably
              increased use of these data. We address advances in event
              categorization schemes and software programs that automatically
              produce data by ``reading'' news stories without human coders. We
              design a method that makes it feasible for the first time to
              evaluate these programs when they are applied in areas with the
              particular characteristics of international conflict and
              cooperation data, namely event categories with highly unequal
              prevalences, and where rare events (such as highly conflictual
              actions) are of special interest. We use this rare events design
              to evaluate one existing program, and find it to be as good as
              trained human coders, but obviously far less expensive to use.
              For large scale data collections, the program dominates human
              coding. Our new evaluative method should be of use in
              international relations, as well as more generally in the field
              of computational linguistics, for evaluating other automated
              information extraction tools. We believe that the data created by
              programs similar to the one we evaluated should see dramatically
              increased use in international relations research. To facilitate
              this process, we are releasing with this article data on 4.3
              million international events, covering the entire world for the
              last decade.",

  abstract = "This article presents several applications of the score statistic
              in the context of output assessment for Monte Carlo simulations.
              We begin by observing that the expected value of the score
              statistic U is zero, and that when the inverse of the information
              matrix I = E(UUT) exists, the asymptotic distribution of UTI−1U
              is $\chi$2. Thus, we may monitor the sample mean of this
              statistic throughout a simulation as a means to determine whether
              or not the simulation has been run for a sufficiently long
              time.We also demonstrate a second convergence assessment method
              based upon the idea of path sampling, but first show how the
              score statistic can be used to accurately estimate the stationary
              density using only a small number of simulated values. These
              methods provide a powerful suite of tools which can be
              generically applied when alternatives such as the Rao-Blackwell
              density estimator are not available. Our second convergence
              assessment method is based upon these density estimates. By
              running several replications of the chain, the corresponding
              estimated densities may be compared to assess how ``close'' the
              chains are to one another and to the true stationary
              distribution. We explain how this may be done using both L1 and
              L2 distance measures.We first illustrate these new methods via
              the analysis of MCMC output arising from some simulated examples,
              emphasizing the advantages of our methods over existing
              diagnostics. We further illustrate the utility of our methods
              with three examples: analyzing a set of real time series data, a
              collection of censored survival data, and bivariate normal data
              using a model with a nonidentified parameter.",

               to assume missing at random-that is, that the probability a
               person responds is independent of their response to the question
               of interest, y, conditional on fully-observed covariates x or on
               sampling weights w. In this paper, we discuss weakening these
               assumptions without the use of additional covariates in the
               special case of a binary outcome variable, y = 0 or 1. We note
               frequentist confidence bounds that do not rely on strong
               assumptions about the response mechanism. From a Bayesian
               perspective, we discuss using prior distributions to average
               over uncertainty in the missing data mechanism. Surprisingly, a
               natural-looking ``noninformative'' prior distribution yields
               unappealing posterior inferences. We discuss methods of
               constructing informative prior distributions using hierarchical
               data structures. We also show how to incorporate unequal
               sampling weights into the model using design-based sampling
               theory. This is important so that the nonresponse modeling can
               be an improvement upon rather than merely a replacement for
               standard weighted analysis of sample surveys. We illustrate the
               hierarchical model by applying it to the state-level analysis of
               a series of national pre-election opinion polls. The use of a
               reasonable prior distribution for the relative response
               probabilities leads to substantial improvements in coverage of
               posterior intervals and prediction error of point estimates. We
               also consider the sensitivity to the prior distribution and the
               effect of including sampling weights in the analysis.",

  abstract = "Behavioral economics tells us that emotions can profoundly affect
              individual behavior and decision-making. Does this also apply to
              societies at large, i.e. can societies experience mood states
              that affect their collective decision making? By extension is the
              public mood correlated or even predictive of economic indicators?
              Here we investigate whether measurements of collective mood
              states derived from large-scale Twitter feeds are correlated to
              the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) over time.
              We analyze the text content of daily Twitter feeds by two mood
              tracking tools, namely OpinionFinder that measures positive vs.
              negative mood and Google-Profile of Mood States (GPOMS) that
              measures mood in terms of 6 dimensions (Calm, Alert, Sure, Vital,
              Kind, and Happy). We cross-validate the resulting mood time
              series by comparing their ability to detect the public's response
              to the presidential election and Thanksgiving day in 2008. A
              Granger causality analysis and a Self-Organizing Fuzzy Neural
              Network are then used to investigate the hypothesis that public
              mood states, as measured by the OpinionFinder and GPOMS mood time
              series, are predictive of changes in DJIA closing values. Our
              results indicate that the accuracy of DJIA predictions can be
              significantly improved by the inclusion of specific public mood
              dimensions but not others. We find an accuracy of 86.7\% in
              predicting the daily up and down changes in the closing values of
              the DJIA and a reduction of the Mean Average Percentage Error

              because of the required nested operations of maximizing and

              pure averaging (for probability trees) are both relatively simple
              because the maximum of a maximum is a maximum, and the average of
              an average is an average. But when the two operators are mixed,
              no simplification is possible, and one must evaluate the
              maximization and averaging operations in a nested fashion,
              following the structure of the tree. Nested evaluation requires
              large sample sizes (for data collection) or long computation
              times (for simulations). An alternative to full nested evaluation
              is to perform a random sample of evaluations and use statistical
              methods to perform inference about the entire tree. We show that

               iterative simulation methods are potentially very helpful for
               summarizing multivariate distributions. Used naively, however,
               iterative simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods
               are simple and generally applicable to the output of any
               iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers
               primarily interested in the science underlying the data and
               models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers
               interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative
               simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use
               several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from
               an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative
               simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest,
               a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper
               the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were
               continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied
               inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems,
               which often tend toward normality after transformations and
               marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory
               approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the
               observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a

              This problem appears in many settings, most prominently in
              choosing the number of clusters in mixture models or the number
              of factors in factor analysis. In this tutorial, we describe
              Bayesian nonparametric methods, a class of methods that
              side-steps this issue by allowing the data to determine the
              complexity of the model. This tutorial is a high-level
              introduction to Bayesian nonparametric methods and contains
              several examples of their application.",

              more likely to vote Republican but rich states are more likely to
              support the Democrats. Previous research argued that this seeming
              paradox could be explained by comparing rich and poor voters
              within each state -- the difference in the Republican vote share
              between rich and poor voters was much larger in low-income,

              the case for the 2012 Presidential election. Based on this

                   (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and
                   sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC
                   methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order
                   gradient information. These features allow it to converge to
                   high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than
                   simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs
                   sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to
                   two user-specified parameters: a step size
                   \{\textbackslash{}epsilon\} and a desired number of steps L.
                   In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits
                   undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large
                   the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn
                   Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need
                   to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm
                   to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide
                   swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically
                   when it starts to double back and retrace its steps.
                   Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and
                   sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC
                   method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning
                   runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size
                   parameter \{\textbackslash{}epsilon\} on the fly based on
                   primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no
                   hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications
                   such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require
                   efficient ``turnkey'' sampling algorithms.",

               attain their goals through bluffs. Sartori theorizes that

                 parameters of interest, such as cancer rates or average
                 pollutant concentrations by county. It is well known that
                 plotting observed rates can have serious drawbacks when sample
                 sizes vary by area, since very high (and low) observed rates
                 are found disproportionately in poorly-sampled areas.
                 Unfortunately, adjusting the observed rates to account for the
                 effects of small-sample noise can introduce an opposite
                 effect, in which the highest adjusted rates tend to be found
                 disproportionately in well-sampled areas. In either case, the
                 maps can be difficult to interpret because the display of
                 spatial variation in the underlying parameters of interest is
                 confounded with spatial variation in sample sizes. As a
                 result, spatial patterns occur in adjusted rates even if there
                 is no spatial structure in the underlying parameters of
                 interest, and adjusted rates tend to look too uniform in areas
                 with little data. We introduce two models (normal and Poisson)
                 in which parameters of interest have no spatial patterns, and
                 demonstrate the existence of spatial artefacts in inference
                 from these models. We also discuss spatial models and the
                 extent to which they are subject to the same artefacts. We
                 present examples from Bayesian modelling, but, as we explain,

              research on the role of territory in the origin and war proneness
              of rivalries is presented. Recent research has shown that states
              that are rivals are much more likely to go to war than are other
              states, and that about half the wars fought since 1815 have
              involved states that are rivals. This review describes the
              origins of interstate rivalries in terms of whether they begin
              over territorial disputes, policy disputes, or disputes over the
              nature of a state's regime. It finds that states that dispute
              territory have a greater probability of becoming rivals than
              expected by chance, compared with states that dispute other
              issues. It also investigates the extent to which territorial

                 Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study representing 43,727
                 participants with 699,632 person-years of follow-up were
                 included. Baseline data were collected by an in-person
                 interview on the basis of standardized questionnaires and a
                 medical examination, including fasting blood chemistry
                 analysis, anthropometry, blood pressure, electrocardiography,
                 and a maximal graded exercise test, between February 3, 1971,

                 quantify the association between coffee consumption and
                 all-cause and cause-specific mortality. RESULTS: During the
                 17-year median follow-up, 2512 deaths occurred (804 [32\%] due
                 to cardiovascular disease). In multivariate analyses, coffee
                 intake was positively associated with all-cause mortality in
                 men. Men who drank more than 28 cups of coffee per week had
                 higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.21; 95\% CI,
                 1.04-1.40). However, after stratification based on age,
                 younger (28 cups per week) and all-cause mortality after
                 adjusting for potential confounders and fitness level (HR,

                 1.26-3.59 for women). CONCLUSION: In this large cohort, a
                 positive association between coffee consumption and all-cause
                 mortality was observed in men and in men and women younger
                 than 55 years. On the basis of these findings, it seems
                 appropriate to suggest that younger people avoid heavy coffee
                 consumption (ie, averaging >4 cups per day). However, this

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Childhood lead exposure is a purported risk factor
                 for antisocial behavior, but prior studies either relied on
                 indirect measures of exposure or did not follow participants
                 into adulthood to examine the relationship between lead
                 exposure and criminal activity in young adults. The objective
                 of this study was to determine if prenatal and childhood blood
                 lead concentrations are associated with arrests for criminal
                 offenses. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Pregnant women were recruited
                 from four prenatal clinics in Cincinnati, Ohio if they resided
                 in areas of the city with a high concentration of older,
                 lead-contaminated housing. We studied 250 individuals, 19 to
                 24 y of age, out of 376 children who were recruited at birth
                 between 1979 and 1984. Prenatal maternal blood lead
                 concentrations were measured during the first or early second
                 trimester of pregnancy. Childhood blood lead concentrations
                 were measured on a quarterly and biannual basis through 6.5 y.
                 Study participants were examined at an inner-city pediatric
                 clinic and the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center
                 in Cincinnati, Ohio. Total arrests and arrests for offenses
                 involving violence were collected from official Hamilton
                 County, Ohio criminal justice records. Main outcomes were the
                 covariate-adjusted rate ratios (RR) for total arrests and
                 arrests for violent crimes associated with each 5 microg/dl
                 (0.24 micromol/l) increase in blood lead concentration.
                 Adjusted total arrest rates were greater for each 5 microg/dl
                 (0.24 micromol/l) increase in blood lead concentration: RR =
                 1.40 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-1.85) for prenatal
                 blood lead, 1.07 (95\% CI 0.88-1.29) for average childhood
                 blood lead, and 1.27 (95\% CI 1.03-1.57) for 6-year blood
                 lead. Adjusted arrest rates for violent crimes were also
                 greater for each 5 microg/dl increase in blood lead: RR = 1.34
                 (95\% CI 0.88-2.03) for prenatal blood lead, 1.30 (95\% CI
                 1.03-1.64) for average childhood blood lead, and 1.48 (95\% CI
                 1.15-1.89) for 6-year blood lead. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal and
                 postnatal blood lead concentrations are associated with higher
                 rates of total arrests and/or arrests for offenses involving
                 violence. This is the first prospective study to demonstrate
                 an association between developmental exposure to lead and

  abstract = "Do economic sanctions destabilize the governments they target? A
              form of foreign pressure, sanctions are typically meant to alter
              the policies of other countries. There is much pessimism on
              whether they ever work. This article shows that economic pressure
              works in at least one respect: it destabilizes the leaders it
              targets. I present a theoretical argument that explains why
              destabilization is a necessary condition for successful coercion.
              I find evidence that pressure destabilizes in a large panel of
              cross-country time-series data. The destabilization finding
              indicates that sanctions may be more effective at altering
              policies than we think. I conclude by noting that greater
              optimism regarding the effectiveness of sanctions should be
              balanced by a careful consideration of the policy’s real and
              sizeable costs for those caught in the middle.",

               about the usage of Bayesian statistics and statistical graphics

               Bayesians might do some exploratory data analysis (EDA) to start
               with, but once the model or class of models is specified, the

  abstract    = "OBJECTIVE: In the modern healthcare system, rapidly expanding
                 costs/complexity, the growing myriad of treatment options, and
                 exploding information streams that often do not effectively
                 reach the front lines hinder the ability to choose optimal
                 treatment decisions over time. The goal in this paper is to
                 develop a general purpose (non-disease-specific)
                 computational/artificial intelligence (AI) framework to
                 address these challenges. This framework serves two potential
                 functions: (1) a simulation environment for exploring various
                 healthcare policies, payment methodologies, etc., and (2) the
                 basis for clinical artificial intelligence - an AI that can
                 ``think like a doctor''. METHODS: This approach combines
                 Markov decision processes and dynamic decision networks to
                 learn from clinical data and develop complex plans via
                 simulation of alternative sequential decision paths while
                 capturing the sometimes conflicting, sometimes synergistic
                 interactions of various components in the healthcare system.
                 It can operate in partially observable environments (in the
                 case of missing observations or data) by maintaining belief
                 states about patient health status and functions as an online
                 agent that plans and re-plans as actions are performed and new
                 observations are obtained. This framework was evaluated using
                 real patient data from an electronic health record. RESULTS:
                 The results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach; such
                 an AI framework easily outperforms the current
                 treatment-as-usual (TAU) case-rate/fee-for-service models of
                 healthcare. The cost per unit of outcome change (CPUC) was
                 $189 vs. $497 for AI vs. TAU (where lower is considered
                 optimal) - while at the same time the AI approach could obtain
                 a 30-35\% increase in patient outcomes. Tweaking certain AI
                 model parameters could further enhance this advantage,
                 obtaining approximately 50\% more improvement (outcome change)
                 for roughly half the costs. CONCLUSION: Given careful design
                 and problem formulation, an AI simulation framework can
                 approximate optimal decisions even in complex and uncertain
                 environments. Future work is described that outlines potential
                 lines of research and integration of machine learning

  abstract  = "Entropy is ubiquitous in physics, and it plays important roles
               in numerous other disciplines ranging from logic and statistics
               to biology and economics. However, a closer look reveals a
               complicated picture: entropy is defined differently in different
               contexts, and even within the same domain different notions of
               entropy are at work. Some of these are defined in terms of
               probabilities, others are not. The aim of this chapter is to
               arrive at an understanding of some of the most important notions
               of entropy and to clarify the relations between them, After
               setting the stage by introducing the thermodynamic entropy
               (Section 2), we discuss notions of entropy in information theory
               (Section 3), statistical mechanics (Section 4), dynamical
               systems theory (Section 5) and fractal geometry (Section 6).",

              educated in some countries, including the USA. However, in many
              countries, no such differences are observed. One classical
              explanation of the presence or absence of this inequality in
              voting is that the strength of left-wing forces sharpens or
              reduces it. An alternative explanation is that some institutional
              arrangements and contextual features disproportionately affect
              the voter participation of some individuals depending on their
              resources, thus shaping turnout inequality. These theories are
              tested using multilevel modeling with data from 28 advanced
              industrial democracies. Compulsory voting reduces inequalities
              because under this system quasi-universal turnout is achieved. In
              addition, the poorly educated vote more frequently when the
              voting procedure is easy and when there are few political
              parties, thus reducing turnout inequality. However, strong
              left-wing parties and trade unions are not associated with more

                 rise in productivity during recent recessions. The first is
                 that the decline in the workforce was not random, and that the
                 average worker was of higher quality during the recession than
                 in the preceding period. The second is that each worker
                 produced more while holding worker quality constant. We call
                 the second effect, ``making do with less,'' that is, getting
                 more effort from fewer workers. Using data spanning June 2006
                 to May 2010 on individual worker productivity from a large
                 firm, it is possible to measure the increase in productivity

                 independent relationships of television viewing or other
                 screen-based entertainment (``screen time'') with all-cause
                 mortality and clinically confirmed cardiovascular disease
                 (CVD) events. A secondary objective was to examine the extent
                 to which metabolic (body mass index, high-density lipoprotein
                 and total cholesterol) and inflammatory (C-reactive protein)
                 markers mediate the relationship between screen time and CVD
                 events. BACKGROUND: Although some evidence suggests that
                 prolonged sitting is linked to CVD risk factor development
                 regardless of physical activity participation, studies with
                 hard outcomes are scarce. METHODS: A population sample of
                 4,512 (1,945 men) Scottish Health Survey 2003 respondents (≥35
                 years) were followed up to 2007 for all-cause mortality and
                 CVD events (fatal and nonfatal combined). Main exposures were
                 interviewer-assessed screen time (<2 h/day; 2 to <4 h/day; and
                 ≥4 h/day) and moderate to vigorous intensity physical
                 activity. RESULTS: Two hundred fifteen CVD events and 325
                 any-cause deaths occurred during 19,364 follow-up
                 person-years. The covariable (age, sex, ethnicity, obesity,
                 smoking, social class, long-standing illness, marital status,
                 diabetes, hypertension)-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for
                 all-cause mortality was 1.52 (95\% confidence interval [CI]:
                 1.06 to 2.16) and for CVD events was 2.30 (95\% CI: 1.33 to
                 3.96) for participants engaging in ≥4 h/day of screen time
                 relative to <2 h/day. Adjusting for physical activity
                 attenuated these associations only slightly (all-cause
                 mortality: HR: 1.48, 95\% CI: 1.04 to 2.13; CVD events: HR:
                 2.25, 95\% CI: 1.30 to 3.89). Exclusion of participants with
                 CVD events in the first 2 years of follow-up and previous
                 cancer registrations did not change these results appreciably.
                 Approximately 25\% of the association between screen time and
                 CVD events was explained collectively by C-reactive protein,
                 body mass index, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Recreational sitting, as reflected by
                 television/screen viewing time, is related to raised mortality
                 and CVD risk regardless of physical activity participation.

                 ratings. Lead was assayed from whole blood using inductively
                 coupled plasma mass spectrometry with a method detection limit
                 of .3 microg/dL. RESULTS: Blood lead levels were slightly
                 below United States and Western Europe population exposure
                 averages, with a mean of .73 and a maximum of 2.2 microg/dL.
                 This is the lowest level of blood lead ever studied in
                 relation to ADHD. After statistical control for covariates
                 including IQ and prenatal smoking exposure, blood lead was
                 associated with ADHD-combined type but not inattentive type.
                 Parent and teacher report indicated association of blood lead
                 with Conners cognitive problems, but only teacher report
                 showed effects on DSM-IV inattention symptoms. Blood lead was
                 associated with hyperactivity-impulsivity in parent report
                 regardless of measurement method, whereas teacher report
                 effects depended on child treatment history. CONCLUSIONS:
                 These findings confirm that in children with typical US
                 population lead exposure, careful identification of children
                 with ADHD also identifies children with slightly elevated
                 blood lead.",

  abstract = "Social scientists typically devote considerable effort to
              reducing measurement error during data collection and then ignore
              the issue during data analysis. Although many statistical methods
              have been proposed for reducing measurement error-induced biases,
              few have been widely used because of implausible assumptions,
              high levels of model dependence, difficult computation, or
              inapplicability with multiple mismeasured variables. We develop
              an easy-to-use alternative that generalizes the popular multiple
              imputation (MI) framework by treating missing data problems as a
              special case of extreme measurement error and correcting for
              both. Like MI, the proposed ``multiple overimputation'' (MO)
              framework is a simple two-step procedure. First, multiple (5)
              completed copies of the data set are created where cells measured
              without error are held constant, those missing are imputed from
              the distribution of predicted values, and cells (or entire
              variables) with measurement error are ``overimputed,'' that is
              imputed from a predictive distribution with observation-level
              priors defined by the mismeasured values and available external
              information, if any. In the second step, analysts can then run
              whatever statistical method they would have run on each of the
              overimputed data sets as if there had been no missingness or
              measurement error; the results are then combined via a simple
              procedure. We also (will) offer open source software that
              implements all the methods described herein.",

                 recognize both viable and nonviable parts of microorganisms.
                 Immune activation may direct the immune response, thus
                 conferring tolerance to allergens such as animal dander or
                 tree and grass pollen. METHODS: Parents of children who were 6
                 to 13 years of age and were living in rural areas of Germany,
                 Austria, or Switzerland where there were both farming and
                 nonfarming households completed a standardized questionnaire
                 on asthma and hay fever. Blood samples were obtained from the
                 children and tested for atopic sensitization; peripheral-blood
                 leukocytes were also harvested from the samples for testing.
                 The levels of endotoxin in the bedding used by these children
                 were examined in relation to clinical findings and to the
                 cytokine-production profiles of peripheral-blood leukocytes
                 that had been stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and
                 staphylococcal enterotoxin B. Complete data were available for
                 812 children. RESULTS: Endotoxin levels in samples of dust
                 from the child's mattress were inversely related to the
                 occurrence of hay fever, atopic asthma, and atopic
                 sensitization. Nonatopic wheeze was not significantly
                 associated with the endotoxin level. Cytokine production by
                 leukocytes (production of tumor necrosis factor alpha,
                 interferon-gamma, interleukin-10, and interleukin-12) was
                 inversely related to the endotoxin level in the bedding,
                 indicating a marked down-regulation of immune responses in
                 exposed children. CONCLUSIONS: A subject's environmental
                 exposure to endotoxin may have a crucial role in the
                 development of tolerance to ubiquitous allergens found in
                 natural environments.",

  title     = "Theory of Rational Option Pricing",
  author    = "Merton, Robert C",
  abstract  = "The long history of the theory of option pricing began in 1900
               when the French mathematician Louis Bachelier deduced an option
               pricing formula based on the assumption that stock prices follow
               a Brownian motion with zero drift. Since that time, numerous
               researchers have contributed to the theory. The present paper
               begins by deducing a set of restrictions on option pricing
               formulas from the assumption that investors prefer more to less.
               These restrictions are necessary conditions for a formula to be
               consistent with a rational pricing theory. Attention is given to
               the problems created when dividends are paid on the underlying
               common stock and when the terms of the option contract can be
               changed explicitly by a change in exercise price or implicitly
               by a shift in the investment or capital structure policy of the
               firm. Since the deduced restrictions are not sufficient to
               uniquely determine an option pricing formula, additional
               assumptions are introduced to examine and extend the seminal
               Black-Scholes theory of option pricing. Explicit formulas for
               pricing both call and put options as well as for warrants and
               the new ``down-and-out'' option are derived. The effects of
               dividends and call provisions on the warrant price are examined.
               The possibilities for further extension of the theory to the
               pricing of corporate liabilities are discussed.",

  author   = "Green, Kesten C and Armstrong, J Scott",
  abstract = "When forecasting decisions in conflict situations, experts are
              often advised to figuratively stand in the other person’s shoes.
              We refer to this as ``role thinking'', because, in practice, the
              advice is to think about how other protagonists will view the
              situation in order to predict their decisions. We tested the
              effect of role thinking on forecast accuracy. We obtained 101
              role-thinking forecasts of the decisions that would be made in
              nine diverse conflicts from 27 Naval postgraduate students
              (experts) and 107 role-thinking forecasts from 103 second-year
              organizational behavior students (novices). The accuracy of the
              novices’ forecasts was 33\% and that of the experts’ was 31\%;
              both were little different from chance (guessing), which was
              28\%. The small improvement in accuracy from role-thinking
              strengthens the finding from earlier research that it is not
              sufficient to think hard about a situation in order to predict
              the decisions which groups of people will make when they are in
              conflict. Instead, it is useful to ask groups of role players to
              simulate the situation. When groups of novice participants
              adopted the roles of protagonists in the aforementioned nine
              conflicts and interacted with each other, their group decisions
              predicted the actual decisions with an accuracy of 60\%.",

               to reveal unusual patterns that might suggest problems with the
               imputations, comparisons of the distributions of observed and

  title    = "Why Do Some Civil Wars Last So Much Longer than Others?",
  author   = "Fearon, James D",
  abstract = "Five factors are shown to be strongly related to civil war
              duration. Civil wars emerging from coups or revolutions tend to
              be short. Civil wars in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet
              Union have also tended to be relatively brief, as have
              anti-colonial wars. By contrast, ‘sons of the soil’ wars that
              typically involve land conflict between a peripheral ethnic
              minority and state-supported migrants of a dominant ethnic group
              are on average quite long-lived. So are conflicts in which a
              rebel group derives major funding from contraband such as opium,
              diamonds, or coca. The article seeks to explain these
              regularities, developing a game model focused on the puzzle of
              what prevents negotiated settlements to long-running, destructive
              civil wars for which conflicting military expectations are an
              implausible explanation. In the model, regional autonomy deals
              may be unreachable when fluctuations in state strength undermine
              the government’s ability to commit. The commitment problem binds
              harder when the center has an enduring political or economic
              interest in expansion into the periphery, as in ‘sons of the
              soil’ wars, and when either government or rebels are able to earn
              some income during a conflict despite the costs of fighting, as
              in the case of contraband funding.",

              Studies. This paper claims that the New Economic Geography has
              now become ‘middle-aged’. On the one hand, the New Economic
              Geography is said to be of less relevance when describing current
              developments in advanced economies because it focuses more on
              tangible causes of the spatial concentration of economic
              activities, and not so much on intangible sources, such as
              information spillovers. On the other hand, the paper states that
              recent developments in developing economies like China are quite
              in line with the core--periphery model that predicts increasing
              regional specialization as a result of economic integration.
              Although both economists and geographers study these spatial
              processes, no fruitful exchange between the two is expected

              Einerseits gilt die Neue Wirtschaftsgeografie als weniger

              cooperation as well as local interactions can. Adaptive agents
              play a four-move Prisoner's Dilemma game, where an agent's

              move, and the probability of cooperating contingent on the
              partner's previous choice. After playing with four others, an
              agent adjusts its strategy so that more successful strategies are
              better represented in the succeeding round. The surprising result
              is that if the pattern of interactions is selected at random, but
              is persistent over time, cooperation emerges just as strongly as
              it does when interactions are geographically local. This has

              changes in our energy infrastructure. Here, we analyze the
              feasibility of providing worldwide energy for all purposes
              (electric power, transportation, heating/cooling, etc.) from
              wind, water, and sunlight (WWS). In Part I, we discuss WWS energy
              system characteristics, current and future energy demand,
              availability of WWS resources, numbers of WWS devices, and area
              and material requirements. In Part II, we address variability,
              economics, and policy of WWS energy. We estimate that ∼3,800,000
              5 MW wind turbines, ∼49,000 300 MW concentrated solar plants,
              ∼40,000 300 MW solar PV power plants, ∼1.7 billion 3 kW rooftop
              PV systems, ∼5350 100 MW geothermal power plants, ∼270 new 1300

              ∼490,000 1 MW tidal turbines can power a 2030 WWS world that uses
              electricity and electrolytic hydrogen for all purposes. Such a
              WWS infrastructure reduces world power demand by 30\% and
              requires only ∼0.41\% and ∼0.59\% more of the world's land for
              footprint and spacing, respectively. We suggest producing all new
              energy with WWS by 2030 and replacing the pre-existing energy by
              2050. Barriers to the plan are primarily social and political,
              not technological or economic. The energy cost in a WWS world

@ARTICLE{Wald1949-kq,
  title     = "Statistical Decision Functions",
  author    = "Wald, Abraham",
  abstract  = "The foundations of a general theory of statistical decision
               functions, including the classical non-sequential case as well
               as the sequential case, was discussed by the author in a
               previous publication [3]. Several assumptions made in [3]
               appear, however, to be unnecessarily restrictive (see conditions
               1-7, pp. 297 in [3]). These assumptions, moreover, are not
               always fulfilled for statistical problems in their conventional
               form. In this paper the main results of [3], as well as several
               new results, are obtained from a considerably weaker set of
               conditions which are fulfilled for most of the statistical
               problems treated in the literature. It seemed necessary to
               abandon most of the methods of proofs used in [3] (particularly
               those in section 4 of [3]) and to develop the theory from the
               beginning. To make the present paper self-contained, the basic
               definitions already given in [3] are briefly restated in section
               2.1. In [3] it is postulated (see Condition 3, p. 207) that the
               space $\Omega$ of all admissible distribution functions F is
               compact. In problems where the distribution function F is known
               except for the values of a finite number of parameters, i.e.,
               where $\Omega$ is a parametric class of distribution functions,
               the compactness condition will usually not be fulfilled if no
               restrictions are imposed on the possible values of the
               parameters. For example, if $\Omega$ is the class of all
               univariate normal distributions with unit variance, $\Omega$ is
               not compact. It is true that by restricting the parameter space
               to a bounded and closed subset of the unrestricted space,
               compactness of $\Omega$ will usually be attained. Since such a
               restriction of the parameter space can frequently be made in
               applied problems, the condition of compactness may not be too
               restrictive from the point of view of practical applications.
               Nevertheless, it seems highly desirable from the theoretical
               point of view to eliminate or to weaken the condition of
               compactness of $\Omega$. This is done in the present paper. The
               compactness condition is completely omitted in the discrete case
               (Theorems 2.1-2.5), and replaced by the condition of
               separability of $\Omega$ in the continuous case (Theorems
               3.1-3.4). The latter condition is fulfilled in most of the
               conventional statistical problems. Another restriction
               postulated in [3] (Condition 4, p. 297) is the continuity of the
               weight function W(F, d) in F. As explained in section 2.1 of the
               present paper, the value of W(F, d) is interpreted as the loss
               suffered when F happens to be the true distribution of the
               chance variables under consideration and the decision d is made
               by the statistician. While the assumption of continuity of W(F,
               d) in F may seem reasonable from the point of view of practical
               application, it is rather undesirable from the theoretical point
               of view for the following reasons. It is of considerable
               theoretical interest to consider simplified weight functions
               W(F, d) which can take only the values 0 and 1 (the value 0
               corresponds to a correct decision, and the value 1 to a wrong
               decision). Frequently, such weight functions are necessarily
               discontinuous. Consider, for example, the problem of testing the
               hypothesis H that the mean $\vartheta$ of a normally distributed
               chance variable X with unit variance is equal to zero. Let d1
               denote the decision to accept H, and d2 the decision to reject
               H. Assigning the value zero to the weight W whenever a correct
               decision is made, and the value 1 whenever a wrong decision is
               made, we have: W($\vartheta$, d1) = 0 for $\vartheta$ = 0, and =
               1 for $\vartheta$ ≠ 0; W ($\vartheta$, d2) = 0 for $\vartheta$ ≠
               0, and = 1 for $\vartheta$ = 0. This weight function is
               obviously discontinuous. In the present paper the main results
               (Theorems 2.1-2.5 and Theorems 3.1-3.4) are obtained without
               making any continuity assumption regarding W(F, d). The
               restrictions imposed in the present paper on the cost function
               of experimentation are considerably weaker than those formulated
               in [3]. Condition 5 [3, p. 297] concerning the class $\Omega$ of
               admissible distribution functions, and condition 7 [3, p. 298]
               concerning the class of decision functions at the disposal of
               the statistician are omitted here altogether. One of the new
               results obtained here is the establishment of the existence of
               so called minimax solutions under rather weak conditions
               (Theorems 2.3 and 3.2). This result is a simple consequence of
               two lemmas (Lemmas 2.4 and 3.3) which seem to be of interest in
               themselves. The present paper consists of three sections. In the
               first section several theorems are given concerning zero sum two
               person games which go somewhat beyond previously published
               results. The results in section 1 are then applied to
               statistical decision functions in sections 2 and 3. Section 2
               treats the case of discrete chance variables, while section 3
               deals with the continuous case. The two cases have been treated
               separately, since the author was not able to find any simple and
               convenient way of combining them into a single more general

              an existing model is reparameterized, solely for computational
              purposes, but then this new configuration motivates a new family
              of models that is useful in applied statistics. One reason why
              this phenomenon may not have been noticed in statistics is that
              reparameterizations do not change the likelihood. In a Bayesian
              framework, however, a transformation of parameters typically

               Wings: Differential Scaling and Evolutionary Change",
  author    = "Kingslover, Joel G and Koehl, M A R",
  abstract  = "We examine several aerodynamic and thermoregulatory hypotheses
               about possible adaptive factors in the evolution of wings from
               small winglets in insects. Using physical models of Paleozoic
               insects in a wind tunnel, we explore the potential effects of
               wings for increasing gliding distance, increasing dispersal
               distance during parachuting, improving attitude control or
               stability, and elevating body temperatures during
               thermoregulation. The effects of body size and shape, wing
               length, number, and venation, and meteorological conditions are
               considered. Hypotheses consistent with both fixed and moveable
               wing articulations are examined. Short wings have no significant
               effects on any of the aerodynamic characteristics, relative to
               wingless models, while large wings do have significant effects.
               In contrast, short wings have large thermoregulatory effects
               relative to wingless models, but further increases in wing
               length do not significantly affect thermoregulatory performance.
               At any body size, there is a wing length below which there are
               significant thermoregulatory effects of increasing wing length,
               and above which there are significant aerodynamic effects of
               increasing wing length. The relative wing length at which this
               transition occurs decreases with increasing body size. These
               results suggest that there could be no effective selection for
               increasing wing length in wingless or short-winged insects in
               relation to increased aerodynamic capacity. Our results are
               consistent with the hypothesis that insect wings initially
               served a thermoregulatory function and were used for aerodynamic
               functions only at larger wing lengths and/or body sizes. Thus,
               we propose that thermoregulation was the primary adaptive factor
               in the early evolution of wings that preadapted them for the
               subsequent evolution of flight. Our results illustrate an
               evolutionary mechanism in which a purely isometric change in
               body size may produce a qualitative change in the function of a
               given structure. We propose a hypothesis in which the transition
               from thermoregulatory to aerodynamic function for wings involved
               only isometric changes in body size and argue that changes in
               body form were not a prerequisite for this major evolutionary
               change in function.",

              We propose that the relationship is so familiar that exposure to
              alcohol cues primes expectations of cognitive impairment. Across
              five studies, we find that in the absence of any evidence of
              reduced cognitive performance, people who hold an alcoholic
              beverage are perceived to be less intelligent than those who do
              not, a mistake we term the imbibing idiot bias. In fact, merely
              priming observers with alcohol cues causes them to judge targets
              who hold no beverage at all as less intelligent. The bias is not
              driven by a belief that less intelligent people are more likely
              to consume alcohol. We find that the bias may be costly in
              professional settings. Job candidates who ordered wine during an

              less hireable than candidates who ordered soda. However,

              transportation, and heating/cooling), everywhere in the world,
              from wind, water, and the sun (WWS). In Part I, we described the
              prominent renewable energy plans that have been proposed and
              discussed the characteristics of WWS energy systems, the global
              demand for and availability of WWS energy, quantities and areas
              required for WWS infrastructure, and supplies of critical
              materials. Here, we discuss methods of addressing the variability
              of WWS energy to ensure that power supply reliably matches demand
              (including interconnecting geographically dispersed resources,
              using hydroelectricity, using demand-response management, storing
              electric power on site, over-sizing peak generation capacity and
              producing hydrogen with the excess, storing electric power in
              vehicle batteries, and forecasting weather to project energy
              supplies), the economics of WWS generation and transmission, the
              economics of WWS use in transportation, and policy measures
              needed to enhance the viability of a WWS system. We find that the
              cost of energy in a 100\% WWS will be similar to the cost today.
              We conclude that barriers to a 100\% conversion to WWS power

                 is to first impute the unobserved data, then perform all
                 statistical analyses on the completed dataset--corresponding
                 to the observed data and imputed unobserved data--using
                 standard procedures for complete-data inference. Here, we
                 extend this approach to model checking by demonstrating the
                 advantages of the use of completed-data model diagnostics on
                 imputed completed datasets. The approach is set in the
                 theoretical framework of Bayesian posterior predictive checks
                 (but, as with missing-data imputation, our methods of
                 missing-data model checking can also be interpreted as
                 ``predictive inference'' in a non-Bayesian context). We
                 consider the graphical diagnostics within this framework.
                 Advantages of the completed-data approach include: (1) One can
                 often check model fit in terms of quantities that are of key
                 substantive interest in a natural way, which is not always
                 possible using observed data alone. (2) In problems with
                 missing data, checks may be devised that do not require to
                 model the missingness or inclusion mechanism; the latter is
                 useful for the analysis of ignorable but unknown data
                 collection mechanisms, such as are often assumed in the
                 analysis of sample surveys and observational studies. (3) In
                 many problems with latent data, it is possible to check
                 qualitative features of the model (for example, independence
                 of two variables) that can be naturally formalized with the
                 help of the latent data. We illustrate with several applied
                 examples.",

              U.S. preelection polls for 1988 and 1992, poststratified by
              state, region, and the usual demographic variables. We evaluate

                 the net resource costs of an intervention per year of life
                 saved. To improve the comparability of cost-effectiveness
                 ratios arrived at with diverse methods, we established fixed
                 definitional goals and revised published estimates, when
                 necessary and feasible, to meet these goals. The 587
                 interventions identified ranged from those that save more
                 resources than they cost, to those costing more than 10
                 billion dollars per year of life saved. Overall, the median

              stops by the New York Police Department over a 15-month period.
              We disaggregate stops by police precinct and compare stop rates

              addressing the question of geographic heterogeneity that arises
              in the analysis of pedestrian stops. We find that persons of

               models is a fundamental computational problem for many
               statistical and scientific studies. Monte Carlo simulation is an
               effective technique, especially with complex and
               high-dimensional models. This paper aims to bring to the
               attention of general statistical audiences of some effective
               methods originating from theoretical physics and at the same
               time to explore these methods from a more statistical
               perspective, through establishing theoretical connections and
               illustrating their uses with statistical problems. We show that
               the acceptance ratio method and thermodynamic integration are
               natural generalizations of importance sampling, which is most
               familiar to statistical audiences. The former generalizes
               importance sampling through the use of a single ``bridge''
               density and is thus a case of bridge sampling in the sense of
               Meng and Wong. Thermodynamic integration, which is also known in
               the numerical analysis literature as Ogata's method for
               high-dimensional integration, corresponds to the use of
               infinitely many and continuously connected bridges (and thus a
               ``path''). Our path sampling formulation offers more flexibility
               and thus potential efficiency to thermodynamic integration, and
               the search of optimal paths turns out to have close connections
               with the Jeffreys prior density and the Rao and Hellinger
               distances between two densities. We provide an informative
               theoretical example as well as two empirical examples (involving
               17- to 70-dimensional integrations) to illustrate the potential
               and implementation of path sampling. We also discuss some open

                 health, independently of participation in physical activity.
                 Socioeconomic position (SEP) is known to relate strongly to
                 physical activity participation but we know very little about
                 how SEP relates to sedentary behaviour. This study aimed to
                 assess the relationships between SEP, neighbourhood
                 deprivation and an index of sedentary time. METHODS:
                 Cross-sectional study of a representative sample of 7940
                 Scottish adults who participated in the 2003 Scottish Health
                 Survey, which collected information on SEP (household income,
                 social class and education), neighbourhood deprivation
                 (Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation), television and other
                 screen-based entertainment time, and physical activity.
                 RESULTS: The three indicators of SEP and deprivation index
                 were independently of each other associated with daily times
                 of television and other screen-based entertainment, even after
                 adjustment for occupational and leisure-time physical
                 activity, health status, smoking, alcohol drinking, car
                 ownership and body mass index: income p = 0.002; social class
                 p<0.001; education p<0.001, deprivation p<0.001. Also, there
                 was a strong cumulative effect of SEP (a composite scale where
                 0 = lowest, 9 = highest SEP position) with those in the lowest
                 SEP spending an additional 109 minutes each day on
                 screen-based entertainment compared to those in the highest
                 socioeconomic position (p<0.001 for linear trend). CONCLUSION:
                 Adverse socioeconomic position is associated with a cumulative
                 increase in the time spent on screen-based entertainment.
                 Reducing inequalities would be expected to reduce exposure to
                 sedentary behaviours, such as excessive screen-based
                 entertainment times, and therefore reduce the risk of chronic

              manuscript, he picks up several random papers, cites them and
              also copies a fraction of their references (cond-mat/0305150).
              The model was stimulated by our discovery that a majority of
              scientific citations are copied from the lists of references used
              in other papers (cond-mat/0212043). It accounted quantitatively
              for several properties of empirically observed distribution of
              citations. However, important features, such as power-law
              distribution of citations to papers published during the same
              year and the fact that the average rate of citing decreases with
              aging of a paper, were not accounted for by that model. Here we
              propose a modified model: when a scientist writes a manuscript,
              he picks up several random recent papers, cites them and also
              copies some of their references. The difference with the original
              model is the word recent. We solve the model using methods of the
              theory of branching processes, and find that it can explain the
              aforementioned features of citation distribution, which our
              original model couldn't account for. The model can also explain
              ``sleeping beauties in science'', i.e., papers that are little
              cited for a decade or so, and later ``awake'' and get a lot of
              citations. Although much can be understood from purely random
              models, we find that to obtain a good quantitative agreement with

              between subjects. In reality, however, altruism usually requires
              interaction between givers and receivers, which clearly must
              influence choices. Charities, for example, speak of the ``power
              of asking.'' Indeed, evolutionary theories of altruism are built
              on human sociality. We experimentally examine communication in
              which one subject allocates $10 between herself and a receiver,
              and systematically altered who in the pair could speak. We found
              that any time the recipient spoke, giving increased --- asking is
              powerful. But when only allocators could speak, choices were
              significantly more selfish than any other condition. When empathy
              was heightened by putting allocators ``in the receiver's shoes,''
              giving appeared as if recipients had been able to ask, even when
              they were silent. We conclude that communication dramatically
              influences altruistic behavior, and appears to largely work by
              heightening empathy.",

  title       = "Measuring the Complexity of the Law: The United States Code",
  author      = "Katz, Daniel Martin and Bommarito, Michael James",
  abstract    = "Einstein’s razor, a corollary of Ockham’s razor, is often
                 paraphrased as follows: make everything as simple as possible,
                 but not simpler. This rule of thumb describes the challenge
                 that designers of a legal system face --- to craft simple laws
                 that produce desired ends, but not to pursue simplicity so far
                 as to undermine those ends. Complexity, simplicity’s inverse,
                 taxes cognition and increases the likelihood of suboptimal
                 decisions. In addition, unnecessary legal complexity can drive
                 a misallocation of human capital toward comprehending and
                 complying with legal rules and away from other productive
                 ends. While many scholars have offered descriptive accounts or
                 theoretical models of legal complexity, empirical research to
                 date has been limited to simple measures of size, such as the
                 number of pages in a bill. No extant research rigorously
                 applies a meaningful model to real data. As a consequence, we
                 have no reliable means to determine whether a new bill,
                 regulation, order, or precedent substantially effects legal
                 complexity. In this paper, we address this need by developing
                 a proposed empirical framework for measuring relative legal
                 complexity. This framework is based on ``knowledge
                 acquisition,'' an approach at the intersection of psychology
                 and computer science, which can take into account the
                 structure, language, and interdependence of law. We then
                 demonstrate the descriptive value of this framework by
                 applying it to the U.S. Code’s Titles, scoring and ranking
                 them by their relative complexity. Our framework is flexible,
                 intuitive, and transparent, and we offer this approach as a
                 first step in developing a practical methodology for assessing
                 legal complexity.",

                 time series or spatial data) summarize errors in y, for
                 instance by integrating (or summing) the squared difference
                 between predicted and measured values over a range of x. We
                 propose an approach which recognizes that errors can occur in
                 the x-direction as well. Instead of just measuring the
                 difference between the predictions and observations at each
                 site (or time), we first ``deform'' the predictions,
                 stretching or compressing along the x-direction or directions,
                 so as to improve the agreement between the observations and
                 the deformed predictions. Error is then summarized by (a) the
                 amount of deformation in x, and (b) the remaining difference
                 in y between the data and the deformed predictions (i.e., the
                 residual error in y after the deformation). A parameter,
                 lambda, controls the tradeoff between (a) and (b), so that as
                 lambda-->infinity no deformation is allowed, whereas for
                 lambda=0 the deformation minimizes the errors in y. In some
                 applications, the deformation itself is of interest because it
                 characterizes the (temporal or spatial) structure of the
                 errors. The optimal deformation can be computed by solving a
                 system of nonlinear partial differential equations, or, for a
                 unidimensional index, by using a dynamic programming
                 algorithm. We illustrate the procedure with examples from

                 rationality as such, and seems to be strengthened by the rise
                 and practical success of Bayesian statistics. We argue that
                 the most successful forms of Bayesian statistics do not
                 actually support that particular philosophy but rather accord
                 much better with sophisticated forms of
                 hypothetico-deductivism. We examine the actual role played by
                 prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial
                 aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall
                 outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on
                 the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and
                 also on our experience of applied work in social science.
                 Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy
                 of science, but also statistical practice. At best, the
                 inductivist view has encouraged researchers to fit and compare
                 models without checking them; at worst, theorists have

               observations of nations' decisions to use force are
               interdependent and censored. For example, suppose a weak nation
               (B) is threatened by a powerful neighbor (A). If B believes A's
               threat, then it should back down. Unfortunately, this censors
               our ability to observe whether A would actually use violence.
               Many traditional methods ignore this censoring and mis-specify
               the extent to which variables influence crisis behavior. To
               ameliorate the problems of interdependence and censoring, I
               develop the Strategically Censored Discrete Choice model.
               Estimating this model using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo
               simulation methods, I analyze Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman's

               problem, which has plagued users of statistical methods for over
               75 years: How can researchers reliably infer individual-level
               behavior from aggregate (ecological) data? In political science,
               this question arises when individual-level surveys are
               unavailable (for instance, local or comparative electoral
               politics), unreliable (racial politics), insufficient (political
               geography), or infeasible (political history). This ecological
               inference problem also confronts researchers in numerous areas
               of major significance in public policy, and other academic
               disciplines, ranging from epidemiology and marketing to
               sociology and quantitative history. Although many have attempted
               to make such cross-level inferences, scholars agree that all
               existing methods yield very inaccurate conclusions about the

  author    = "Hodges, J S",
  abstract  = "Recent advances in computing make it practical to use complex
               hierarchical models. However, the complexity makes it difficult
               to see how features of the data determine the fitted model. This
               paper describes an approach to diagnostics for hierarchical
               models, specifically linear hierarchical models with additive
               normal or t-errors. The key is to express hierarchical models in
               the form of ordinary linear models by adding artificial `cases'
               to the data set corresponding to the higher levels of the
               hierarchy. The error term of this linear model is not
               homoscedastic, but its covariance structure is much simpler than
               that usually used in variance component or random effects
               models. The re-expression has several advantages. First, it is
               extremely general, covering dynamic linear models, random effect
               and mixed effect models, and pairwise difference models, among
               others. Second, it makes more explicit the geometry of
               hierarchical models, by analogy with the geometry of linear
               models. Third, the analogy with linear models provides a rich
               source of ideas for diagnostics for all the parts of
               hierarchical models. This paper gives diagnostics to examine
               candidate added variables, transformations, collinearity, case
               influence and residuals.",

               In a linear regression model without interactions, this average
               predictive comparison is simply a regression coefficient (with
               associated uncertainty). In a model with nonlinearity or
               interactions, however, the average predictive comparison in
               general depends on the values of the predictors. We consider
               various definitions based on averages over a population
               distribution of the predictors, and we compute standard errors
               based on uncertainty in model parameters. We illustrate with a
               study of criminal justice data for urban counties in the United
               States. The outcome of interest measures whether a convicted
               felon received a prison sentence rather than a jail or
               non-custodial sentence, with predictors available at both
               individual and county levels. We fit three models: (1) a

               the within-county intercepts as well as for each individual
               predictor; (2) a hierarchical model with varying intercepts
               only; and (3) a nonhierarchical model that ignores the
               multilevel nature of the data. The regression coefficients have
               different interpretations for the different models; in contrast,
               the models can be compared directly using predictive
               comparisons. Furthermore, predictive comparisons clarify the
               interplay between the individual and county predictors for the

                 manipulate perception of race, each resume is assigned either
                 a very African American sounding name or a very White sounding
                 name. The results show significant discrimination against
                 African-American names: White names receive 50 percent more
                 callbacks for interviews. We also find that race affects the
                 benefits of a better resume. For White names, a higher quality
                 resume elicits 30 percent more callbacks whereas for African
                 Americans, it elicits a far smaller increase. Applicants
                 living in better neighborhoods receive more callbacks but,
                 interestingly, this effect does not differ by race. The amount
                 of discrimination is uniform across occupations and
                 industries. Federal contractors and employers who list Equal
                 Opportunity Employer' in their ad discriminate as much as
                 other employers. We find little evidence that our results are
                 driven by employers inferring something other than race, such
                 as social class, from the names. These results suggest that

                 diffusion of new methods for modelling longitudinal data.
                 Multilevel (also known as hierarchical or random effects)
                 models for binary outcomes have generally been based on a
                 logistic-normal specification, by analogy with earlier work
                 for normally distributed data. The appropriate application and
                 interpretation of these models remains somewhat unclear,
                 especially when compared with the computationally more
                 straightforward semiparametric or 'marginal' modelling (GEE)
                 approaches. In this paper we pose two interrelated questions.
                 First, what limits should be placed on the interpretation of
                 the coefficients and inferences derived from random-effect
                 models involving binary outcomes? Second, what diagnostic
                 checks are appropriate for evaluating whether such
                 random-effect models provide adequate fits to the data? We
                 address these questions by means of an extended case study
                 using data on adolescent smoking from a large cohort study.
                 Bayesian estimation methods are used to fit a discrete-mixture
                 alternative to the standard logistic-normal model, and
                 posterior predictive checking is used to assess model fit.
                 Surprising parallels in the parameter estimates from the
                 logistic-normal and mixture models are described and used to
                 question the interpretability of the so-called
                 'subject-specific' regression coefficients from the standard
                 multilevel approach. Posterior predictive checks suggest a
                 serious lack of fit of both multilevel models. The results do
                 not provide final answers to the two questions posed, but we
                 expect that lessons learned from the case study will provide
                 general guidance for further investigation of these important

  title     = "Early warning analysis for social diffusion events",
  author    = "Colbaugh, Richard and Glass, Kristin",
  abstract  = "There is considerable interest in developing predictive
               capabilities for social diffusion processes, for instance to
               permit early identification of emerging contentious situations,
               rapid detection of disease outbreaks, or accurate forecasting of
               the ultimate reach of potentially ``viral'' ideas or behaviors.
               This paper proposes a new approach to this predictive analytics
               problem, in which analysis of meso-scale network dynamics is
               leveraged to generate useful predictions for complex social
               phenomena. We begin by deriving a stochastic hybrid dynamical
               systems (S-HDS) model for diffusion processes taking place over
               social networks with realistic topologies; this modeling
               approach is inspired by recent work in biology demonstrating
               that S-HDS offer a useful mathematical formalism with which to
               represent complex, multi-scale biological network dynamics. We
               then perform formal stochastic reachability analysis with this
               S-HDS model and conclude that the outcomes of social diffusion
               processes may depend crucially upon the way the early dynamics
               of the process interacts with the underlying network’s community
               structure and core-periphery structure. This theoretical finding
               provides the foundations for developing a machine learning
               algorithm that enables accurate early warning analysis for
               social diffusion events. The utility of the warning algorithm,
               and the power of network-based predictive metrics, are
               demonstrated through an empirical investigation of the
               propagation of political ``memes'' over social media networks.
               Additionally, we illustrate the potential of the approach for
               security informatics applications through case studies involving
               early warning analysis of large-scale protests events and
               politically-motivated cyber attacks.",

               identified significant vulnerabilities, despite the fact that
               Multics was more secure than other contemporary (and current)
               computer systems. Considerably more important than any of the
               individual design and implementation flaws was the demonstration
               of subversion of the protection mechanism using malicious
               software (e.g., trap doors and Trojan horses). A series of
               enhancements were suggested that enabled Multics to serve in a
               relatively benign environment. These included addition of
               ``mandatory access controls'' and these enhancements were
               greatly enabled by the fact the Multics was designed from the
               start for security. However, the bottom-line conclusion was that
               ``restructuring is essential'' around a verifiable ``security
               kernel'' before using Multics (or any other system) in an open
               environment (as in today's Internet) with the existence of
               well-motivated professional attackers employing subversion. The
               lessons learned from the vulnerability assessment are highly
               applicable today as governments and industry strive
               (unsuccessfully) to ``secure'' today's weaker operating systems

  author   = "Ostrum, Elinor",
  abstract = "Extensive empirical evidence and theoretical developments in
              multiple disciplines stimulate a need to expand the range of
              rational choice models to be used as a foundation for the study
              of social dilemmas and collective action. After an introduction
              to the problem of overcoming social dilemmas through collective
              action, the remainder of this article is divided into six
              sections. The first briefly reviews the theoretical predictions
              of currently accepted rational choice theory related to social
              dilemmas. The second section summarizes the challenges to the
              sole reliance on a complete model of rationality presented by
              extensive experimental research. In the third section, I discuss
              two major empirical findings that begin to show how individuals
              achieve results that are ``better than rational'' by building
              conditions where reciprocity, reputation, and trust can help to
              overcome the strong temptations of short-run self-interest. The
              fourth section raises the possibility of developing
              second-generation models of rationality, the fifth section
              develops an initial theoretical scenario, and the final section
              concludes by examining the implications of placing reciprocity,
              reputation, and trust at the core of an empirically tested,

  author   = "Terrill, W Andrew",
  abstract = "Abstract As the 1990--1991 Gulf crisis unfolded, leaders of the
              UN coalition against Iraq became increasingly concerned about the
              possibility of terrorism accompanying the initiation of
              hostilities with Baghdad. Such concerns were reinforced by Iraqi
              warnings and by Baghdad's long association with international
              terrorist movements. Ultimately, however, the Iraqis proved
              unable to make effective use of terrorism to support their war
              effort. This failure resulted for a variety of reasons including
              effective counterterrorism measures by the allies. Additionally,
              a number of other nations with terrorist linkages pressured their
              terrorist clients to refrain from helping Saddam Hussein. They
              did this for reasons of their own that nevertheless supported
              allied strategy. Finally, the Iraqis’ lack of any precrisis
              preparation for terrorist action meant that they were simply
              unable to mount more than a few ineffective operations.",

                 association between habitual consumption of caffeinated
                 beverages and incident hypertension is uncertain. OBJECTIVE:
                 To examine the association between caffeine intake and
                 incident hypertension in women. DESIGN, SETTING, AND
                 PARTICIPANTS: Prospective cohort study conducted in the
                 Nurses' Health Studies (NHSs) I and II of 155,594 US women
                 free from physician-diagnosed hypertension followed up over 12
                 years (1990-1991 to 2002-2003 questionnaires). Caffeine intake
                 and possible confounders were ascertained from regularly
                 administered questionnaires. We also tested the associations
                 with types of caffeinated beverages. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE:
                 Incident physician-diagnosed hypertension. RESULTS: During
                 follow-up, 19,541 incident cases of physician-diagnosed
                 hypertension were reported in NHS I and 13,536 in NHS II. In
                 both cohorts, no linear association between caffeine
                 consumption and risk of incident hypertension was observed
                 after multivariate adjustment (NHS I, P for trend = .29; NHS
                 II, P for trend = .53). Using categorical analysis, an inverse
                 U-shaped association between caffeine consumption and incident
                 hypertension was found. Compared with participants in the
                 lowest quintile of caffeine consumption, those in the third
                 quintile had a 13\% and 12\% increased risk of hypertension,
                 respectively (95\% confidence interval in NHS I, 8\%-18\%; in
                 NHS II, 6\%-18\%). When studying individual classes of
                 caffeinated beverages, habitual coffee consumption was not
                 associated with increased risk of hypertension. By contrast,
                 consumption of cola beverages was associated with an increased
                 risk of hypertension, independent of whether it was sugared or
                 diet cola (P for trend <.001). CONCLUSION: No linear
                 association between caffeine consumption and incident
                 hypertension was found. Even though habitual coffee
                 consumption was not associated with an increased risk of
                 hypertension, consumption of sugared or diet cola was
                 associated with it. Further research to elucidate the role of
                 cola beverages in hypertension is warranted.",

  author   = "Gelman, Andrew and King, Gary",
  abstract = "We demonstrate the surprising benefits of legislative
              redistricting (including partisan gerrymandering) for American
              representative democracy. In so doing, our analysis resolves two
              long-standing controversies in American politics. First, whereas
              some scholars believe that redistricting reduces electoral
              responsiveness by protecting incumbents, others, that the
              relationship is spurious, we demonstrate that both sides are
              wrong: redistricting increases responsiveness. Second, while some
              researchers believe that gerrymandering dramatically increases
              partisan bias and others deny this effect, we show both sides are
              in a sense correct. Gerrymandering biases electoral systems in
              favor of the party that controls the redistricting as compared to
              what would have happened if the other party controlled it, but
              any type of redistricting reduces partisan bias as compared to an
              electoral system without redistricting. Incorrect conclusions in
              both literatures resulted from misjudging the enormous
              uncertainties present during redistricting periods, making
              simplified assumptions about the redistricters’ goals, and using

                 activity, walking, and sports and exercises. MVIA levels were
                 classified as being inactive, being insufficiently active,
                 being sufficiently active for general health benefits and
                 being sufficiently active for obesity prevention. Sedentary
                 time was defined as television and other screen-based
                 entertainment time (TVSE). Dependent variables were
                 BMI-defined obesity (BMI-OB) and WC-defined obesity (WC-OB).
                 TVSE was positively related to both WC-OB (adjusted OR 1.69

                 (95 \% CI 1.64, 2.58)), but only walking was related to BMI-OB
                 (OR 1.94; 95 \% CI 1.58, 2.37). Domestic physical activity was
                 not related to BMI-OB or WC-OB. In conclusion, physical
                 activity and sedentary behaviour are independently related to
                 obesity. Public health recommendations should both promote
                 physical activity and discourage engagement in sedentary
                 pursuits.",

                 to understand the conditions required for the emergence and
                 maintenance of cooperation in evolving populations. For many
                 situations, kin selection is an adequate explanation, although
                 kin-recognition may still be a problem. Explanations of
                 cooperation between non-kin include continuing interactions
                 that provide a shadow of the future (that is, the expectation
                 of an ongoing relationship) that can sustain reciprocity,
                 possibly supported by mechanisms to bias interactions such as
                 embedding the agents in a two-dimensional space or other
                 context-preserving networks. Another explanation, indirect
                 reciprocity, applies when benevolence to one agent increases
                 the chance of receiving help from others. Here we use computer
                 simulations to show that cooperation can arise when agents
                 donate to others who are sufficiently similar to themselves in
                 some arbitrary characteristic. Such a characteristic, or
                 'tag', can be a marking, display, or other observable trait.
                 Tag-based donation can lead to the emergence of cooperation
                 among agents who have only rudimentary ability to detect
                 environmental signals and, unlike models of direct or indirect
                 reciprocity, no memory of past encounters is required.",

               causes of elite consolidation, but Medicean political control
               was produced by means of network disjunctures within the elite,
               which the Medici alone spanned. Cosimo de' Medici's multivocal
               identity as sphinx harnessed the power available in these
               network holes and resolved the contradiction between judge and
               boss inherent in all organizations. Methodologically, we argue
               that to understand state formation one must penetrate beneath
               the veneer of formal institutions, groups, and goals down to the
               relational substrata of peoples' actual lives. Ambiguity and
               heterogeneity, not planning and self- interest, are the raw

  abstract = "Individuals in a committee or election can increase their voting
              power by forming coalitions. This behavior is shown here to yield
              a prisoner's dilemma, in which a subset of voters can increase
              their power, while reducing average voting power for the
              electorate as a whole. This is an unusual form of the prisoner's
              dilemma in that cooperation is the selfish act that hurts the
              larger group. Under a simple model, the privately optimal
              coalition size is approximately 1.4 times the square root of the
              number of voters. When voters' preferences are allowed to differ,
              coalitions form only if voters are approximately politically
              balanced. We propose a dynamic view of coalitions, in which
              groups of voters choose of their own free will to form and
              disband coalitions, in a continuing struggle to maintain their
              voting power. This is potentially an endogenous mechanism for
              political instability, even in a world where individuals'
              (probabilistic) preferences are fixed and known.",

               complex interactions by multiple actors in political landscapes
               that are continuously evolving, yet classical theoretical
               approaches to the subject leave many important questions
               unanswered. Here Michael Laver and Ernest Sergenti offer the
               first comprehensive treatment of party competition using the
               computational techniques of agent-based modeling. This exciting
               new technology enables researchers to model competition between
               several different political parties for the support of voters
               with widely varying preferences on many different issues. Laver
               and Sergenti model party competition as a true dynamic process
               in which political parties rise and fall, a process where
               different politicians attack the same political problem in very
               different ways, and where today's political actors, lacking
               perfect information about the potential consequences of their
               choices, must constantly adapt their behavior to yesterday's
               political outcomes. Party Competition shows how agent-based
               modeling can be used to accurately reflect how political systems
               really work. It demonstrates that politicians who are satisfied
               with relatively modest vote shares often do better at winning
               votes than rivals who search ceaselessly for higher shares of
               the vote. It reveals that politicians who pay close attention to
               their personal preferences when setting party policy often have
               more success than opponents who focus solely on the preferences
               of voters, that some politicians have idiosyncratic ``valence''
               advantages that enhance their electability--and much more.",

  title    = "Mind the map! The impact of transit maps on path choice in public
              transit",
  author   = "Guo, Zhan",
  abstract = "This paper investigates the impact of schematic transit maps on
              passengers’ travel decisions. It does two things: First, it
              proposes an analysis framework that defines four types of
              information delivered from a transit map: distortion,
              restoration, codification, and cognition. It then considers the
              potential impact of this information on three types of travel
              decisions: location, mode, and path choices.1Path refers to a
              unique sequence of entry, transfer, and exit stations/stops in
              the public transit network. The author differentiates between
              path and route choices because the latter could refer to a
              situation among different service routes that follow the same
              physical path, which is not the purpose of this analysis. 1
              Second, it conducts an empirical analysis to explore the impact
              of the famous London tube map on passengers’ path choice in the
              London Underground (LUL). Using data collected by LUL from 1998
              to 2005, the paper develops a path choice model and compares the
              influence between the distorted tube map (map distance) and
              reality (travel time) on passengers’ path choice behavior.
              Results show that the elasticity of the map distance is twice
              that of the travel time, which suggests that passengers often
              trust the tube map more than their own travel experience on
              deciding the ``best'' travel path. This is true even for the most
              experienced passengers using the system. The codification of
              transfer connections on the tube map, either as a simple dot or
              as an extended link, could affect passengers’ transfer decisions.
              The implications to transit operation and planning, such as trip
              assignments, overcrowding mitigation, and the deployment of
              Advanced Transit Information System (ATIS), are also discussed.",

              examine what the United States can learn about making its
              healthcare system more efficient. We focus primarily on
              understanding contemporaneous differences in the level of
              spending, generally from the 2000s. Medical spending differs
              across countries either because the price of services differs
              (for example, a coronary bypass surgery operation may cost more
              in the United States than in other countries) or because people
              receive more services in some countries than in others (for
              example, more bypass surgery operations). Within the price
              category, there are two further issues: whether factors earn
              different returns across countries and whether more clinical or
              administrative personnel are required to deliver the same care in
              different countries. We first present the results of a
              decomposition of healthcare spending along these lines in the
              United States and in Canada. We then delve into each component in
              more detail---administrative costs, factor prices, and the
              provision of care received---bringing in a broader range of
              international evidence when possible. Finally, we touch upon the

               likely. First, the model of the Prisoner's Dilemma is used to
               demonstrate that cooperation is more likely when the costs of
               being exploited and the gains of exploiting others are low, when
               the gains from mutual cooperation and the costs of mutual
               noncooperation are high, and when each side expects the other to
               cooperate. Second, the security dilemma is ameliorated when the
               defense has the advantage over the offense and when defensive
               postures differ from offensive ones. These two variables, which

                 expression provides a ``square-root rule''; i.e., the optimal
                 number of reinsurers in a market is given asymptotically by
                 the square root of the total number of primary insurers. We
                 note further that an analogous ``fourth-root rule'' applies to
                 markets for retrocession (the reinsurance of reinsurance).",

              have been proposed, which are generally simpler to fit and easier
              to understand than probabilistic models. We claim that
              corresponding to any deterministic model is an implicit
              stochastic model in which the deterministic model fits
              imperfectly, with errors occurring at random. In the context of
              binary data, we consider a model in which the probability of
              error depends on the model prediction. We show how to fit this
              model using a stochastic modification of deterministic
              optimization schemes. The advantages of fitting the stochastic
              model explicitly (rather than implicitly, by simply fitting a
              deterministic model and accepting the occurrence of errors)
              include quantification of uncertainty in the deterministic
              model’s parameter estimates, better estimation of the true model
              error rate, and the ability to check the fit of the model
              nontrivially. We illustrate this with a simple theoretical
              example of item response data and with empirical examples from

  abstract    = "Appropriate models in biostatistics are often quite
                 complicated. Such models are typically most easily fit using
                 Bayesian methods, which can often be implemented using
                 simulation techniques. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods
                 are an important set of tools for such simulations. We give an
                 overview and references of this rapidly emerging technology
                 along with a relatively simple example. MCMC techniques can be
                 viewed as extensions of iterative maximization techniques, but
                 with random jumps rather than maximizations at each step.
                 Special care is needed when implementing iterative
                 maximization procedures rather than closed-form methods, and
                 even more care is needed with iterative simulation procedures:
                 it is substantially more difficult to monitor convergence to a
                 distribution than to a point. The most reliable
                 implementations of MCMC build upon results from simpler models
                 fit using combinations of maximization algorithms and
                 noniterative simulations, so that the user has a rough idea of
                 the location and scale of the posterior distribution of the
                 quantities of interest under the more complicated model. These
                 concerns with implementation, however, should not deter the
                 biostatistician from using MCMC methods, but rather help to
                 ensure wise use of these powerful techniques.",

              models is that any physiological model that is even approximately
              realistic will have a large number of parameters, often
              comparable to the number of observations in a typical
              pharmacokinetic experiment (e.g., 28 measurements and 15
              parameters for each subject). In addition, the parameters are
              generally poorly identified, akin to the well-known
              ill-conditioned problem of estimating a mixture of declining
              exponentials. Our modeling includes (a) hierarchical population
              modeling, which allows partial pooling of information among
              different experimental subjects; (b) a pharmacokinetic model

              because the parameters represent real physiological variables. We

                 rates of household firearm ownership and homicide across the
                 United States, by age groups. METHODS: We used cross-sectional
                 time-series data (1988-1997) to estimate the association
                 between rates of household firearm ownership and homicide.
                 RESULTS: In region- and state-level analyses, a robust
                 association between rates of household firearm ownership and
                 homicide was found. Regionally, the association exists for
                 victims aged 5 to 14 years and those 35 years and older. At
                 the state level, the association exists for every age group
                 over age 5, even after controlling for poverty, urbanization,
                 unemployment, alcohol consumption, and nonlethal violent
                 crime. CONCLUSIONS: Although our study cannot determine
                 causation, we found that in areas where household firearm
                 ownership rates were higher, a disproportionately large number
                 of people died from homicide.",

              Getting Worse! Am {I} Just Dumb?",
  author   = "Meng, Xiao-Li and Xie, Xianchao",
  abstract = "Possibly, but more likely you are merely a victim of conventional
              wisdom. More data or better models by no means guarantee better
              estimators (e.g., with a smaller mean squared error), when you
              are not following probabilistically principled methods such as
              MLE (for large samples) or Bayesian approaches. Estimating
              equations are particularly vulnerable in this regard, almost a
              necessary price for their robustness. These points will be
              demonstrated via common tasks of estimating regression parameters
              and correlations, under simple models such as bivariate normal
              and ARCH(1). Some general strategies for detecting and avoiding
              such pitfalls are suggested, including checking for
              self-efficiency (Meng, 1994; Statistical Science) and adopting a
              guiding working model. Using the example of estimating the
              autocorrelation $\varrho$ under a stationary AR(1) model, we also
              demonstrate the interaction between model assumptions and
              observation structures in seeking additional information, as the
              sampling interval s increases. Furthermore, for a given sample
              size, the optimal s for minimizing the asymptotic variance of is
              s = 1 if and only if $\varrho$2 ≤ 1/3; beyond that region the
              optimal s increases at the rate of log −1($\varrho$−2) as
              $\varrho$ approaches a unit root, as does the gain in efficiency
              relative to using s = 1. A practical implication of this result
              is that the so-called ``non-informative'' Jeffreys prior can be
              far from non-informative even for stationary time series models,
              because here it converges rapidly to a point mass at a unit root
              as s increases. Our overall emphasis is that intuition and
              conventional wisdom need to be examined via critical thinking and
              theoretical verification before they can be trusted fully.",

               the myriad fruits of more than a decade's work, carefully
               'complexifying' his initial model. Like his ideas, his prose is
               clear and engaging. His delight as he unveils each surprising
               discovery is infectious. This book is not merely important; it's
               fun.''--Robert D. Putnam, author of Making Democracy WorkRobert
               Axelrod is widely known for his groundbreaking work in game
               theory and complexity theory. He is a leader in applying
               computer modeling to social science problems. His book The
               Evolution of Cooperation has been hailed as a seminal
               contribution and has been translated into eight languages since
               its initial publication. The Complexity of Cooperation is a
               sequel to that landmark book. It collects seven essays,
               originally published in a broad range of journals, and adds an
               extensive new introduction to the collection, along with new
               prefaces to each essay and a useful new appendix of additional
               resources. Written in Axelrod's acclaimed, accessible style,
               this collection serves as an introductory text on complexity
               theory and computer modeling in the social sciences and as an
               overview of the current state of the art in the field.The
               articles move beyond the basic paradigm of the Prisoner's
               Dilemma to study a rich set of issues, including how to cope
               with errors in perception or implementation, how norms emerge,
               and how new political actors and regions of shared culture can
               develop. They use the shared methodology of agent-based
               modeling, a powerful technique that specifies the rules of
               interaction betweenindividuals and uses computer simulation to
               discover emergent properties of the social system. The
               Complexity of Cooperation is essential reading for all social

                 biological systems pose unique challenges in model building
                 and adjustment. Recent tools from population pharmacokinetics,
                 Bayesian statistical inference, and physiological modeling can
                 be brought together to solve these problems. As an example, we
                 modeled the distribution and metabolism of tetrachloroethylene
                 (PERC) in humans. We derive statistical distributions for the

                 data from Monster et al. (1979). The model adequately fits
                 both prior physiological information and experimental data. An
                 estimate of the relationship between PERC exposure and

                 exposure (0.001 ppm), the median estimate of the fraction
                 metabolized is much higher, at 36\% [95\% confidence interval

                 4.2\% of the sample. Approximately 25\% of the children were
                 exposed to television and screen entertainment at least 3
                 hours/day. In general linear models, television and screen
                 entertainment time per week and physical activity levels were
                 independently associated with the Strengths and Difficulties
                 Questionnaire total difficulties score after adjustment for
                 age, gender, area deprivation level, single-parent status,
                 medical conditions, and various dietary intake indicators.
                 There was also an additive interaction effect showing that the
                 combination of high television and screen entertainment time
                 and low physical activity was associated with the highest
                 Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire score. Higher
                 television and screen entertainment exposure (>2.7 hours/day)
                 alone resulted in a 24\% increase in the Strengths and
                 Difficulties Questionnaire score in comparison with lower
                 television and screen entertainment exposure (<1.6 hours/day),
                 although when combined with low physical activity this
                 resulted in a 46\% increase. CONCLUSION: Higher levels of
                 television and screen entertainment time and low physical
                 activity levels interact to increase psychological distress in
                 young children.",

               computed when the goods travel at close to the speed of light?
               This is a problem because the time taken in transit will appear
               less to an observer traveling with the goods than to a
               stationary observer. A solution is derived from economic theory,

              questions posed. The method is also applicable to a single survey
              in which different questions are asked or different sampling
              methods are used in different strata or clusters. Our method
              involves multiply imputing the missing items and questions by
              adding to existing methods of imputation designed for single
              surveys a hierarchical regression model that allows covariates at

              and if so, does this have negative consequences for daughters
              versus sons? In this paper, we show that child gender affects the
              marital status, family structure, and fertility of a significant
              number of American families. Overall, a first-born daughter is
              significantly less likely to be living with her father compared
              to a first-born son. Three factors are important in explaining
              this gap. First, women with first-born daughters are less likely
              to marry. Strikingly, we also find evidence that the gender of a
              child in utero affects shotgun marriages. Among women who have
              taken an ultrasound test during pregnancy, mothers who have a
              girl are less likely to be married at delivery than those who
              have a boy. Second, parents who have first-born girls are
              significantly more likely to be divorced. Third, after a divorce,
              fathers are much more likely to obtain custody of sons compared
              to daughters. These three factors have serious negative income
              and educational consequences for affected children. What explains
              these findings? In the last part of the paper, we turn to the
              relationship between child gender and fertility to help sort out
              parental gender bias from competing explanations for our
              findings. We show that the number of children is significantly
              higher in families with a first-born girl. Our estimates indicate
              that first-born daughters caused approximately 5500 more births
              per year, for a total of 220,000 more births over the past 40
              years. Taken individually, each piece of empirical evidence is
              not sufficient to establish the existence of parental gender
              bias. But taken together, the weight of the evidence supports the
              notion that parents in the U.S. favour boys over girls.",

               not drawn directly from the density g of real interest, but
               rather from another distribution derived from g by the
               application of an integral operator. The estimation of g then
               entails both statistical and numerical difficulties. A natural
               statistical approach is by maximum likelihood, conveniently
               implemented using the EM algorithm, but this provides
               unsatisfactory reconstructions of g. In this paper, we modify
               the maximum likelihood-EM approach by introducing a simple
               smoothing step at each EM iteration. In our experience, this
               algorithm converges in relatively few iterations to good
               estimates of g that do not depend on the choice of starting
               configuration. Some theoretical background is given that relates
               this smoothed EM algorithm to a maximum penalized likelihood
               approach. Two applications are considered in detail. The first
               is the classical stereology problem of determining particle size
               distributions from data collected on a plane section through a

              hazard analysis, the results suggest that third-party

                 the past few decades is attributable to a reduced microbial
                 burden during childhood, as a consequence of Westernized
                 lifestyle (the 'hygiene hypothesis'). However, the mechanisms
                 by which the reduced exposure of children to pathogenic and
                 nonpathogenic microbes results in enhanced responses of Th2
                 cells are still controversial. The initial interpretation
                 proposed a missing immune deviation of allergen-specific
                 responses from a Th2 to a type 1 Th (Th1) profile, as a result
                 of the reduced production of interleukin-12 and interferons by
                 natural immunity cells which are stimulated by bacterial
                 products via their Toll-like receptors. More recently, the
                 role of reduced activity of T regulatory cells has been
                 emphasized. The epidemiological findings and the experimental
                 evidence available so far suggest that both mechanisms may be
                 involved. A better understanding of this question is important
                 not only from a theoretical point of view, but also because of
                 its therapeutic implications.",

  abstract = "A recent literature has constructed top income shares time series
              over the long run for more than twenty countries using income tax
              statistics. Top incomes represent a small share of the population
              but a very significant share of total income and total taxes
              paid. Hence, aggregate economic growth per capita and Gini
              inequality indexes are sensitive to excluding or including top
              incomes. We discuss the estimation methods and issues that arise
              when constructing top income share series, including income
              definition and comparability over time and across countries, tax
              avoidance, and tax evasion. We provide a summary of the key
              empirical findings. Most countries experience a dramatic drop in
              top income shares in the first part of the twentieth century in
              general due to shocks to top capital incomes during the wars and
              depression shocks. Top income shares do not recover in the
              immediate postwar decades. However, over the last thirty years,
              top income shares have increased substantially in English
              speaking countries and in India and China but not in continental
              European countries or Japan. This increase is due in part to an
              unprecedented surge in top wage incomes. As a result, wage income
              comprises a larger fraction of top incomes than in the past.
              Finally, we discuss the theoretical and empirical models that
              have been proposed to account for the facts and the main

              seemingly most natural Gibbs and Metropolis algorithms can
              sometimes be slow. We examine solutions that involve
              reparameterization and over-parameterization. We begin with
              parameter expansion using working parameters, a strategy
              developed for the EM algorithm. This strategy can lead to
              algorithms that are much less susceptible to becoming stuck near
              zero values of the variance parameters than are more standard
              algorithms. Second, we consider a simple rotation of the
              regression coefficients based on an estimate of their posterior
              covariance matrix. This leads to a Gibbs algorithm based on
              updating the transformed parameters one at a time or a Metropolis
              algorithm with vector jumps; either of these algorithms can
              perform much better (in terms of total CPU time) than the two
              standard algorithms: one-at-a-time updating of untransformed
              parameters or vector updating using a linear regression at each
              step. We present an innovative evaluation of the algorithms in
              terms of how quickly they can get away from remote areas of
              parameter space, along with some more standard evaluation of
              computation and convergence speeds. We illustrate our methods

              develop a fast and reliable method for fitting a hierarchical
              linear model as easily as one can now fit a nonhierarchical

  title     = "Inquiry into Democracy: What Might a Pragmatist Make of Rational
               Choice Theories?",
  author    = "Knight, Jack and Johnson, James",
  abstract  = "We begin by positing a conception of pragmatism that is
               characterized by three basic philosophical commitments:
               consequentialism, fallibilism, and anti-skepticism. In light of
               that conception we challenge prevalent views that hold that
               pragmatism entails no particular moral and political positions.
               We argue instead that pragmatism generally has democratic
               implications and, more specifically, that it has implications
               for the assessment and justification of political institutions.
               To develop this position we draw in part on the political
               insights of Dewey. Dewey argued that the greater social and
               economic complexity of twentieth century life creates
               significant problems for democratic society and its
               institutions. The most important of these problems is that
               growing complexity makes it difficult for a democratic public to
               effectively identify either itself or its enduring interests. In
               lieu of a specific remedy, Dewey proposed a form of social
               inquiry that can, by entering into democratic deliberation,
               contribute to the process by which the public might more readily
               define its common interests and, thereby, itself. We argue that
               rational choice theory can assist us in undertaking such a
               pragmatist social inquiry. We draw on two main bodies of recent
               research--on the political economy of U.S. macroeconomic policy
               and on mechanism design--to show the relevance of the rational
               choice approach. We argue both that this research reinforces
               pragmatist preoccupation with democratic deliberation and,
               because pragmatists are naive about institutional matters, that
               their preoccupation is very nearly utopian in the pejorative
               sense.",

                 targeted the cancer cells directly by removing them (surgery)
                 or killing them (chemotherapy and radiation). These modes of
                 therapy have not always been effective because many tumors
                 recur after these therapies, either because not all of the
                 cells are killed (local recurrence) or because the cancer
                 cells had already escaped the primary tumor environment
                 (distant recurrence). There has been an increasing recognition
                 that the tumor microenvironment contains host noncancer cells
                 in addition to cancer cells, interacting in a dynamic fashion
                 over time. The cancer cells compete and/or cooperate with
                 nontumor cells, and the cancer cells may compete and/or
                 cooperate with each other. It has been demonstrated that these
                 interactions can alter the genotype and phenotype of the host
                 cells as well as the cancer cells. The interaction of these
                 cancer and host cells to remodel the normal host organ
                 microenvironment may best be conceptualized as an evolving
                 ecosystem. In classic terms, an ecosystem describes the

                 relation to each other as a unit. Here, we review some

  abstract  = "Outside the Platonic world of financial models, assuming the
               underlying distribution is a scalable ``power law,'' we are
               unable to find a consequential difference between finite and
               infinite variance models---a central distinction emphasized in
               the econophysics literature and the financial economics
               tradition. Although distributions with power law tail exponents
               $\alpha$ > 2 are held to be amenable to Gaussian tools, owing to
               their ``finite variance,'' we fail to understand the difference
               in the application with other power laws (1 < $\alpha$ < 2) held
               to belong to the Pareto-L\'{e}vy-Mandelbrot stable regime. The
               problem invalidates derivatives theory (dynamic hedging
               arguments) and portfolio construction based on mean-variance.
               This article discusses methods to deal with the implications of
               the point in a real world setting. \copyright{} 2008 Wiley

                 he had been able ``to see further only by standing on the
                 shoulders of giants,'' one attributes to the Spanish
                 philosopher Ortega y Gasset the hypothesis saying that
                 top-level research cannot be successful without a mass of
                 medium researchers on which the top rests comparable to an
                 iceberg. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The Ortega hypothesis
                 predicts that highly-cited papers and medium-cited (or
                 lowly-cited) papers would equally refer to papers with a
                 medium impact. The Newton hypothesis would be supported if the
                 top-level research more frequently cites previously
                 highly-cited work than that medium-level research cites
                 highly-cited work. Our analysis is based on (i) all articles
                 and proceedings papers which were published in 2003 in the
                 life sciences, health sciences, physical sciences, and social
                 sciences, and (ii) all articles and proceeding papers which
                 were cited within these publications. The results show that
                 highly-cited work in all scientific fields more frequently
                 cites previously highly-cited papers than that medium-cited
                 work cites highly-cited work. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We
                 demonstrate that papers contributing to the scientific
                 progress in a field lean to a larger extent on previously
                 important contributions than papers contributing little. These
                 findings support the Newton hypothesis and call into question
                 the Ortega hypothesis (given our usage of citation counts as a
                 proxy for impact).",

  abstract    = "The ubiquity of cooperation has motivated a major research
                 program over the last 50 years to discover ever more minimal
                 conditions for the evolution of altruism. One important line
                 of work is based on favoritism toward those who appear to be
                 close relatives. Another important line is based on continuing
                 interactions, whether between individuals (e.g., reciprocity)
                 or between lines of descent in a viscous population. Here, we
                 use an agent-based model to demonstrate a new mechanism that
                 combines both lines of work to show when and how favoritism
                 toward apparently similar others can evolve in the first
                 place. The mechanism is the joint operation of viscosity and
                 of tags (heritable, observable, and initially arbitrary
                 characteristics), which serve as weak and potentially
                 deceptive indicators of relatedness. Although tags are
                 insufficient to support cooperation alone, we show that this
                 joint mechanism vastly increases the range of environments in
                 which contingent altruism can evolve in viscous populations.
                 Even though our model is quite simple, the subtle dynamics
                 underlying our results are not tractable using formal analytic
                 tools (such as analysis of evolutionarily stable strategies),

                   model to illustrate how, even with relatively mild
                   assumptions on each individual's nearest neighbor
                   preferences, an integrated city would likely unravel to a
                   segregated city, even if all individuals prefer integration.
                   Aggregation relates to individuals coming together to form
                   groups and global aggregation corresponds to segregation.
                   Many authors assumed that the segregation which Schelling
                   observed in simulations on very small cities persists for
                   larger, realistic size cities. We devise new measures to
                   quantify the segregation and unlock its dependence on city
                   size, disparate neighbor comfortability threshold, and
                   population density. We identify distinct scales of global
                   aggregation, and show that the striking global aggregation
                   Schelling observed is strictly a small city phenomenon. We
                   also discover several scaling laws for the aggregation

              education and nutrition. One way to do this would be via embryo

              We find that embryo selection, on its own, may have significant
              (but likely not drastic) impacts over the next 50 years, though
              large effects could accumulate over multiple generations.

              gametes -- which has been making rapid progress and which could

@BOOK{Armstrong2014-yc,
  title     = "Smarter Than Us: The Rise of Machine Intelligence",
  author    = "Armstrong, Stuart",
  abstract  = "What happens when machines become smarter than humans? Forget
               lumbering Terminators. The power of an artificial intelligence
               (AI) comes from its intelligence, not physical strength and
               laser guns. Humans steer the future not because we're the
               strongest or the fastest but because we're the smartest. When
               machines become smarter than humans, we'll be handing them the
               steering wheel. What promises---and perils---will these powerful
               machines present? Stuart Armstrong’s new book navigates these
               questions with clarity and wit. Can we instruct AIs to steer the
               future as we desire? What goals should we program into them? It
               turns out this question is difficult to answer! Philosophers
               have tried for thousands of years to define an ideal world, but
               there remains no consensus. The prospect of goal-driven,
               smarter-than-human AI gives moral philosophy a new urgency. The
               future could be filled with joy, art, compassion, and beings
               living worthwhile and wonderful lives---but only if we’re able
               to precisely define what a ``good'' world is, and skilled enough
               to describe it perfectly to a computer program. AIs, like
               computers, will do what we say---which is not necessarily what
               we mean. Such precision requires encoding the entire system of
               human values for an AI: explaining them to a mind that is alien
               to us, defining every ambiguous term, clarifying every edge
               case. Moreover, our values are fragile: in some cases, if we
               mis-define a single piece of the puzzle---say,
               consciousness---we end up with roughly 0\% of the value we
               intended to reap, instead of 99\% of the value. Though an
               understanding of the problem is only beginning to spread,
               researchers from fields ranging from philosophy to computer
               science to economics are working together to conceive and test
               solutions. Are we up to the challenge? A mathematician by
               training, Armstrong is a Research Fellow at the Future of
               Humanity Institute (FHI) at Oxford University. His research
               focuses on formal decision theory, the risks and possibilities
               of AI, the long term potential for intelligent life (and the
               difficulties of predicting this), and anthropic (self-locating)
               probability. Armstrong wrote Smarter Than Us at the request of
               the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, a non-profit

               enormous expected value. Despite their importance, issues
               surrounding human-extinction risks and related hazards remain
               poorly understood. In this article, I clarify the concept of
               existential risk and develop an improved classification scheme.
               I discuss the relation between existential risks and basic
               issues in axiology, and show how existential risk reduction (via
               the maxipok rule) can serve as a strongly action-guiding
               principle for utilitarian concerns. I also show how the notion
               of existential risk suggests a new way of thinking about the
               ideal of sustainability. Policy Implications * • Existential
               risk is a concept that can focus long-term global efforts and
               sustainability concerns. * • The biggest existential risks are
               anthropogenic and related to potential future technologies. * •
               A moral case can be made that existential risk reduction is
               strictly more important than any other global public good. * •
               Sustainability should be reconceptualised in dynamic terms, as
               aiming for a sustainable trajectory rather than a sustainable
               state. * • Some small existential risks can be mitigated today
               directly (e.g. asteroids) or indirectly (by building resilience
               and reserves to increase survivability in a range of extreme
               scenarios) but it is more important to build capacity to improve
               humanity’s ability to deal with the larger existential risks
               that will arise later in this century. This will require
               collective wisdom, technology foresight, and the ability when
               necessary to mobilise a strong global coordinated response to
               anticipated existential risks. * • Perhaps the most
               cost-effective way to reduce existential risks today is to fund
               analysis of a wide range of existential risks and potential
               mitigation strategies, with a long-term perspective.",
