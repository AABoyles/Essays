<h1 class="title toc-ignore">The Elon Musk Forecast Correction Function</h1>

</div>


<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In case you haven’t heard, Elon Musk is <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html">the World’s Raddest Man</a>.</p>
<p>He’s also something of a master of over-promising and late-delivering. He’s reasonably consistent about delivering, just… late. In order to have a problem like this, he must be very good at predicting what <em>can</em> be brought to market. His predictions may contain telling information about when we can expect him to deliver something, it’s just that the numbers are wrong. And because they’re wrong in a biased way (he consistently predicts things will be ready sooner than they are), we can figure out how to <em>correct</em> his predictions.</p>
</div>
<div id="assembling-his-falsifiable-predictions" class="section level2">
<h2>Assembling His (Falsifiable) Predictions</h2>
<p>In science, there’s a really really important concept, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability">falsifiability</a>. Basically, you can make statements like “<a href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3264/how-many-seats-will-the-conservative-and-unionist-party-win-in-the-next-uk-general-election/">Conservatives will win the next election</a>”, but we need to figure out some objective criteria for which that statement is true or false. Does winning mean taking a majority of seats? Or a majority of seats in a coalition government? Or is it just the largest plurality, even if they can’t form the government? In other words, there are a lot of places we can stick a label like “won the election”, but we need to pick one of those in advance of making any predictions. Otherwise, we’re just <a href="https://www.hamilton.edu/documents/Analysis-of-Forcast-Accuracy-in-the-Political-Media.pdf">blowing hot air</a>.</p>
<p>So, we need to find predictions that Elon Musk has publicly stated that are more concrete than “Someday, humans will…” For Musk, that generally means timelines. For example, consider this tweet:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/852581322451111936"><img src="https://aaboyles.github.io/Essays/imgs/Elon.PNG" alt="Pickup truck unveil in 18 to 24 months" /></a></p>
<p>Here, he is making a concrete prediction that Tesla will unveil a pickup truck in 18 to 24 months. Note that Musk made the tweet on 2017-04-13. 18 months later is 2018-10-13, and 24 months later is 2019-04-13. So, did Tesla unveil the pickup truck within the predicted window? <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1170401244310949888">No.</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1106714774694297601/photo/1">He teased, of course</a>, but No.</p>
<p>So, let’s find as many Elon Musk predictions as we can… Or use some that somebody else has already done for us! Bloomberg assembled <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/bbg-gfx/doc-relay/1LbuTU_4Hezk524N_j7hHhDhgbYBuacuX3frK4TzyGrY/data.json">a list</a> for their (much goofier) <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/elon-musk-goals/">take on this topic</a>.</p>

jump-start, but the data is still too thin to be of much use. We need to know all salient dates (Date prediction was made, Date predicted, Date event actually ocurred) in order to assess the predictive accuracy. We need these because we want to compare the difference in temporal distances between them.</p>

<p>Accordingly, I loaded up the ol’ spreadsheet and started manually filling in the blank spaces. This entailed a good deal of manual data cleaning and manipulation. The most important operation was selecting the dates to assign to predictions. For the date on which the prediction was registered, I tried to select the earliest available example of it (almost always <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk">Musk’s Twitter feed</a>). For the date he predicted, I used the principle of charity to select the latest possible date. I ignored date ranges (e.g. “Summer 2017”) in favor of the terminal date that would indicate (2017-09-21). We might also note that some of the predictions include Adjustments–if his initial estimate was wrong, Musk may have later updated the prediction. But there’s nothing privileged these updates–they’re predictions unto themselves. Accordingly, I promoted them to sit in-line with the other predictions. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rRD3CsQLuiglHqma778PCOtAOODcjIs94xcdhRQ6uJE">You can view my rendition of the sheet here.</a></p>

<p>This gives us 96 predictions. The data are still messy and not 100% reliable, but generally accurate and confirmable by the <code>Source1</code> and <code>Source2</code> columns. Given that most of the date fields are now populated, we can create columns of the temopral distance (number of days) between the dates.</p>

<p>Here we can see that we have many predictions in the time range of zero to three years, and a few longer-term predictions. Importantly, we don’t see an obvious rightward-shift in the resolution times of these predictions. That’s not to imply it isn’t there. To see it, however, let’s look at the scatterplot instead.</p>

<p>So, there you have it. If there’s a prediction coming from the Musk-verse, multiply the (upper-bound of the) amount of time by 1.7386726, and add 63 days.</p>
<p>To make this trivially easy, here’s a little calculator! Enter that date of Musk’s Prediction, and it will tell you when it will actually come true:</p>
<div class="jumbotron">
<h2>
The Elon Musk Prediction Correction Calculator
</h2>
<form class="form-inline">
<p>
On <input id="datePredictionMade" class="form-control" type="date">, Elon Musk predicted he’d deliver on <input id="datePredicted" class="form-control" type="date">.
</p>
<p>
He is much more likely to deliver around <span id="predictionResult"></span>.
</p>
</form>

  var threeMonthsFromNow = new Date(90*msPerDay + Date.now()).toISOString().substring(0,10);
  $('#datePredicted').on('change', function(){

    var days = fit(Math.floor((date2 - date1) / msPerDay));
    $('#predictionResult').text(format((new Date(date1.getTime() + days*msPerDay)).toLocaleString()));

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It’s easy to fault Musk for consistently making poor projections like this. However, I think there’s a much more fundamental reason we should celebrate him: he makes public predictions <em>at all</em>.</p>
