Here's a complex one! [Will Donald Trump appoint at least one more Justice to the Supreme Court before the end of his presidency?](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/1498/will-donald-trump-appoint-at-least-one-more-justice-to-the-supreme-court-before-the-end-of-his-presidency/)

$$
P(appointment)=\\
  P(TrumpLoses)*(P(JusticeDies)+P(JusticeRetires)) +\\
  P(TrumpWins)*(1-(1-P(JusticeDies))^5)+(1-(1-P(JusticeRetires))^5)*P(SenateCooperates)
$$

## If Trump Loses in 2020

...We only need to assess the longevity of the justices for another year.
