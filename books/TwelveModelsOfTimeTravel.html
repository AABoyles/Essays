<h1>Foreword</h1>
<p>In this anthology, I have attempted to create a variety of models of time travel with varying degrees of plausibility based on the best research on the subject to date. I have not, however, in any attempted to construct a work that is necessarily factual and true. My hope is that future research will invalidate these stories, and new ones will be written as our collective knowledge of these matters grows.</p>
<p>What follows is an assortment of perspectives on the idea that we can travel backwards in time in one way or another. To the best of my knowledge, none is known to be true, and none is known conclusively to be impossible. I have taken the opportunity to explore many ideas relating to time travel, and where these ideas fit well together, I have combined them. Some of these stories are mutually exclusive, while some (in fact, most) are mutually possible based on current understanding.</p>
<p>I feel terribly silly saying this, but I foresee that perhaps some of these stories may be misconstrued as insight into factual phenomena. As such, I offer this disclaimer: I am not (to the best of my knowledge) any special sort of time traveler, though I would eagerly volunteer to try. I do routinely travel forwards in time, and suspect that I shall continue to do so for the duration of my lifespan. Perhaps my descendants will be luckier than me in this respect. Perhaps they even were.</p>
</div>
<div id="prologue" class="section level1">
<h1>Prologue</h1>
<p>I know what you’re thinking. Time travel doesn’t work–paradoxes and whatnot. I’m perceptive like that. But what if I wasn’t? What if I actually traveled back in time? I could have known what you were thinking because I asked your future self what you were thinking during this conversation. But since I’ve (hypothetically) confessed to traveling back in time, you could resolve to avoid me for the rest of your life. And you could succeed, preempting me from asking you in the future what were you thinking when I mentioned Time Travel. And there is our paradox. So, what were you thinking when I mentioned Time Travel?</p>
</div>
<div id="transmissible" class="section level1">
<h1>Transmissible</h1>
<p>Jen hopped out of the car. “Today is a big day,” she thought to herself. Today was the day they finally started testing.</p>
<p>“Morning, Jen.” Mike sleepily smiled at her as she walked through the glass foyer.</p>
<p>The theory we needed was pretty well-established. Einstein had proposed it a century ago: time dilates. Basically, the speed of light is the speed at which any distance appears to [time dilation].</p>
<p>We just needed to extend that to the marginal case of moving near the speed of light. And when I say near, what I really mean is a-little-bit-greater-than. As in, faster than the speed of light. Uncomfortable yet? If so, I’m afraid it’s gonna get worse: we did it. We did it a long time ago, in fact.</p>
<p>The secret ingredient was Cesium gas–it’s great stuff. Most kids who’ve heard of cesium hear about in their advanced Chemistry classes. Like the other alkali metals, you can drop it in water, and it ionizes the water molecules… let’s say enthusiastically. Drop one of the lighter alkalis–say sodium–in a beaker of water and it’ll give you a satisfying little pop. You drop cesium in a beaker of water, and it’ll blow that beaker into a glass shrapnel bomb. But that’s just what the kids know about it.</p>
<p>Cesium gas exhibits a unique property in that when a pulse of light is sent through it, the atoms will accelerate the light, triggering that time dilation Einstein predicted. The light will exit the cloud of gas before it arrives at the exit. Better yet, If there’s a long enough cloud, you can cause the pulse to exit before it even entered the cloud at all. So, what do you do with knowledge like that? Build the longest cloud you can.</p>
<p>We designed a reflective tube filled with Cesium gas, so that the light’s path could be bent, not unlike the movement of light through fiber optic cable.</p>
<p>Light moves at 300,000km/sec in a vacuum. The cesium accelerated light to almost 300 times that speed. In other words, a 300,000km long vacuum would take 1 second for a beam of light to cross, but an equally long cloud of cesium would take -300 seconds. That is to say, it goes back in time about 5 minutes. Sounds good, right? Think what you could do with a 5 minute leg up on a horse race. Think about the stock market! High-frequency traders spend millions of dollars just to improve their information access by microseconds. 5 minutes is enough time to take over the world.</p>
<p>But the Cesium cable doesn’t need to be 300,000km. What if you took a short cable and wrapped it into a loop trapping the message inside? It would be forced through the path, each time traveling backward in time. Because it was moving backward, it would never coincide with the other times it traveled through because they would have occurred in reality’s future, and in the information’s past. So we just needed enough to transmit a short message.</p>
<p>It’s a strange thing, playing with time. The distance your apparatus covers in a way becomes your bandwidth–more distance permits longer messages. The longer the cesium fiber, the longer the message you could send.</p>
<p>One of our programmers got to thinking: what if we wrote a program that would take input from the future, crunch it, and send it back to itself? For example, what if we gave it a problem in NP? On each iteration, it would either return the correct answer or advance the iteration. But because the iterations were happening simultaneously, the problem would be solved in constant time. The Universe, it seems, may have provided a hack around the most famous question of computability. So we tried it out.</p>
<p>[Try it, it works. Run several tests.]</p>
<p>My partner asked why the answer was always correct. It’s a good question! Presumably in some universe somewhere–hell, sometime–the algorithm needed to iterate up to the right answer, right? Our team statistician really jumped on this one. “Yeah, it’s possible.” She said. “Not likely, though.”</p>
<p>The problem was that the machine ran the calculation in an infinite number of temporal loops–if the answer was correct, return the answer so that it will have appeared to the machine. If not, advance the calculation a little bit and return. But eventually it hits the right answer. It might take billions, trillions, quadrillions of iterations to do it–the numbers can go (almost) as high as you want. Sounds like a tall order, right? But the thing was, once it converged on that stable time loop, it circulated an infinite number of times. So, the probability of being in one of those universes where an intermediate calculations was occurring was equivalent to some really huge number divided by infinity. And any calculus student will happily tell you that’s what zero looks like.</p>
</div>
<div id="reconstructed" class="section level1">
<h1>Reconstructed</h1>
<p>So we figured out how to send information backwards in time. And paradoxical situations would collapse into stable equilibrium. So, what information would you send?</p>
<p>Besides the obvious numbers to impart a leg-up on a gamble, we tried to come up with something that would further improve the world. And that’s how we came up with the neural transfer.</p>
<p>The first humans to travel backwards in time didn’t send their bodies back. Or rather, couldn’t send their bodies back. Using Cesium Gas cycles, they could transmit information, but not matter. It was a case of the teleportation problem: in order to teleport, your body needed to be destroyed in one location and rebuilt in another. To the body in the origin location, teleportation is indistinguishable from complete annihilation.</p>
<p>If you can transmit information back in time, You can travel back in time by storing your neurological state at the moment you want to go back, sending that information back in time, and loading it into your physical consciousness. Same brain, younger body.</p>
<p>This presented a new problem: in order to send a consciousness back in time, that consciousness had to have already received the consciousness. So the information that consciousness gathered in the intervening time between receiving and send was doubled. Tripled. Quadrupled. Multiplied by infinity. The human brain can’t stand that. After receipt, the recipient begs us not to transmit his consciousness.</p>
</div>
<div id="recipient" class="section level1">
<h1>Recipient</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Physical time travel IS possible, but only back as far as the creation of the machine itself–there must be a machine to receive a time traveler. History is fixed–the sequence of events which led to the time travel may depend on the actions of the time travelers from the future in the past. (The Oracle effect: by trying to cause something not to happen, we ironically cause it to happen).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we built the machine, we knew we’d have to turn it on and then wait a little while. We tested the scale model version on a cheap drug-store stopwatch. We built the machine, watched its container for a few hours, and then put the stopwatch in. But then we had a problem–we couldn’t take the watch out again: if the watch was traveling backwards in time, and we were traveling forwards, then the moment we placed the watch in the machine, it either ceased to exist or was somewhere else. Or something.</p>
<p>But then we remembered: when we were testing the machine, we found the watch in the compartment. At the time we’d figured someone on the team was just running a test. It didn’t occur to us that we would be running the test in the future. It was remarkable.</p>
<p>Naturally, we built a human-sized one as soon as we could. It was just a simple scaling problem: build a bigger box. We turned it on and then closed our eyes. We figured that if paradoxes are possible, that doesn’t mean they should be sought after. After three minutes we opened them, and smiled at the thought: right now, one of our colleagues is in the box, experiencing the backwards flow of time, to emerge from the box seconds ago, armed with the knowledge of several hours from now. All that remained was to accumulate some knowledge to which we would only have epistemic access after the machine was turned on, and choose the world’s first real time traveler.</p>
<p>Some of us were more excited by the prospect than others–after all, there’s no reason that the process of traveling backwards in time shouldn’t kill you. The spiritual among us wondered idly if their transcendental components would become disengaged from their bodies if they moved through time in this way.</p>
<p>Personally, I didn’t wonder. I’ll bet people wondered the same about air travel in the early twentieth century. Death by unknown mechanisms was a possibility, but that hardly stopped the explorers of our history: where would we be if humanity was paralyzed at the thought of crossing the Atlantic Ocean to establish a more efficient trade route to the Orient? What would have become of space travel if no one had volunteered to go to the moon? So maybe death was a risk, I was sure as hell ready to take it. Plus there was another little perk: the money.</p>
<p>We’d unanimously agreed not to interact with the traveler, which meant that as soon as s/he stepped out of the machine, the traveler would be free. Unregulated motion, completely unaccountable. After all, you’d be back in the lab the whole time. Think of what you could do with time like that. Have an affair? Murder someone? Drop a few thousand on the Nasdaq’s big performer of the afternoon? We’d all been thinking it, but nobody was talking about it.</p>
<p>To choose the traveler, we decided to roll a d20. After all, all scientists are geeks of one stripe or another, so why not own it? The team was nineteen people (two of whom refused to go), so we each took a number between one and seventeen and agreed to re-roll if eighteen, nineteen or twenty showed up. I was lucky number 7.</p>
</div>
<div id="bounded" class="section level1">
<h1>Bounded</h1>
<p>Time travel is achievable by moving in through a wormhole. This occurs only because it becomes impossible to transmit effects (which expand spherically at the speed of light) to physical and temporal locations in the universe in which a paradox may be created.</p>
<p>We built the first exotic matter ship late in the twenty-first century. We didn’t have any efficient exotic matter manufacturing methods, so the ship was designed for sub-light speed travel (though it was theorized–and later demonstrated–to be capable of super-luminal speeds).</p>
<p>[speculative] Exotic matter also provides a unique opportunity. Just as it created a bubble of normal space around which the time-space continuum could be moved in excess of light speeds, normal-space bubbles could be used to protect spacecraft traveling into black holes. This opened up access to wormholes.</p>
</div>
<div id="unbounded" class="section level1">
<h1>Unbounded</h1>
<p>Exotic matter. I’d read about it science fiction novels–the magical stuff that enabled faster-than-light travel. Time travel is achievable by moving in excess of the speed of light. Travel to locations in which paradoxes may be created is possible, but creating the paradoxes themselves is not easy. You can’t turn around and go back because you’ll pass through the same space as when you traveled there, causing a catastrophic collision. You can visit an intermediary third point on a second spatial plane, but returning home causes you to be three times farther back in time than expected.</p>
<p>The universe is Novikov Self-consistent.</p>
</div>
<div id="grandfather" class="section level1">
<h1>Grandfather</h1>
<p>Characters create a grandfather paradox, which undoes their actions. Time converges on an equilibrium in which their grandfather dies and time travel was never invented. The grandfather’s murder is deemed completely unsolvable. Years later, the bullet striations match a gun created since the man’s death.</p>
</div>
<div id="parallel" class="section level1">
<h1>Parallel</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Characters observe that they are in a different universe because they memorized a truly random event moments before they left, traveled to a time at which they would not have been able to affect that event, and then observe the result of the event, which doesn’t match their memories. They create a grandfather paradox and observe the outcomes unfettered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“How the hell do you test whether you’ve jumped universes?”</p>
<p>I smiled in my own cleverness. “You choose a random variable which cannot possibly be affected by the time travel. You memorize it, and then you travel backwards in time. If the value doesn’t match what’s in your memory, then you’ve jumped universes.”</p>
<p>“But I don’t get it–if all you’ve done is travel to a time which couldn’t have altered the outcome of the random variable, then isn’t the outcome guaranteed to be the same?”</p>
<p>“Not necessarily. The random variable may occur after the journey, but before the traveler can cause any change in the universe which would alter the change. The causal wave created by a traveler’s appearance expands spherically at the speed of light, so the traveler just needs to travel back to a time before the random variable was observed, but far enough away from the event that his/her presence can’t affect it.”</p>
<p>“So it would definitely be the same value in the same universe. What if you do cross universes, but the outcome is the same anyway?”</p>
<p>“Then we won’t know that’s the case. We’ll have learned that either time travel doesn’t cause the traveler to cross between different universes, or that truly random events are, with exceedingly high probability, deterministic. If we travel back and the values match, then one of those two things must be true. We’ll have to figure out another test to figure that one out.”</p>
</div>
<div id="probable" class="section level1">
<h1>Probable</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Outcomes in future visitors’ memories are the product of the decisions made by the natural denizens of the prior time. Travelers can affect their own memories by engineering outcomes to decisions by their predecessors, but realize this often leads to their own excisions (time converges on an equilibrium in which they never traveled back to that time).</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="free" class="section level1">
<h1>Free</h1>
<p>Time Travel is possible independent of the time of the machine’s creation or the paradoxes it creates. The Universe doesn’t need to explain itself–it simply is.</p>
</div>
<div id="immutable" class="section level1">
<h1>Immutable</h1>
<p>Travelers go back in time, attempt to create a Grandfather Paradox, successfully do so, and then travel forwards in time to observe the consequences, only to find the universe they left is unchanged, except that they can remember performing the action.</p>
</div>
<div id="convergent" class="section level1">
<h1>Convergent</h1>
<p>The creators of the time machine recognize the potential destructiveness of the technology, and discretely prevent its creation. They must do so secretly because if the creators of time machines knew they were employing time-travel technology, it would positively verify that time-travel was indeed possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="impossible" class="section level1">
<h1>Impossible</h1>
<p>The closer you come to a paradoxical result, the higher the probability that an experimental error will occur.</p>
