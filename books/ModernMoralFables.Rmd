# An Honorable Necromancer
A Necromancer moves to a village. The villagers protest, but are powerless to prevent the necromancer from living or working near them. Then one day, a villager sneaks to the Necromancer's home, and confesses that he fears death, and would like to be brought back if possible. The necromancer agrees to resuscitate the villager in exchange for a small sum of money.
