# Prologue

From early in life, we are conditioned to believe that consequences are bad things. What English-speaking child of the developed world hasn't heard a threat like "If you don't clean your room, there will be **consequences**."

This book is, in part, a challenge to this prevailing notion. Consequences are more than bad things that happen because of a decision we make: consequences are just things that happen because of a decision we make.

This is my love letter to consequentialism.

# The Consequences of Action

# The Consequences of Inaction

The Trolley Problem.

## Is the FDA Stringent Enough about Medical Trials?

Actually, the FDA is WAY too stringent about safety testing pharmaceuticals.

# Epilogue
We think that if we do nothing, nothing will happen. This is not true. Inaction can be vastly more costly than action.
