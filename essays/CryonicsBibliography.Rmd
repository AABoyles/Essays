This follows my self-education in Cryonics, specifically as I would have ordered these materials if I were to start from the beginning again. This is roughly ordered by technical difficulty: the less technical books are at the top, and more technical works follow at the bottom. At the end, I’ve also included a section of books I simply wouldn’t bother with at all, along with my notes about why they fall here.

## If you only read one thing...

* Read the Wait but Why post, [Why Cryonics Makes Sense](http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/cryonics.html).

# Why Should We Consider Cryonics?

Because living is awesome, of course!

* [The Open Letter on Cryonics](http://www.evidencebasedcryonics.org/scientists-open-letter-on-cryonics/) - There are a bunch of really smart people who openly affirm that Cryonics is a viable avenue to life extension.

* Robin Hanson - [We Agree: Get Froze!](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/12/we-agree-get-froze.html)
* Eliezer Yudkowsky - [You Only Live Twice](http://lesswrong.com/lw/wq/you_only_live_twice/)

# Will it Work?

Probably. However, whether any specific cryonically-preserved individual will be recovered is far less certain.

# How does it work?

# How do I sign up?

As far as I can tell, there are three agencies world-wide doing cryopreservation. They are:

* [Cryonics Institute](http://cryonics.org/become.html)
* [Alcor Life Extension Institution](http://www.alcor.org/BecomeMember/index.html)
* [KrioRus](http://www.kriorus.ru/en)

## Paying for it

* Life Insurance. Contact [Rudi Hoffman](http://www.rudihoffman.com/).
* Cash. If you're pretty wealthy.

# References I Would Skip

There aren't a lot of people writing or talking about cryonics. If something I have read doesn’t contribute to the conversation (but seems popular enough not to ignore), it goes here.
