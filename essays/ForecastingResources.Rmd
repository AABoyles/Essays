## Datasets I Reference Often

* [SSA Actuarial Tables](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html) - [Clean Version](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQ7rRJM5TFdRotQZAJnsoDXu7djMHgKZ2esvcvDlvZuLa_qjbBT-d4DbtnzkWC3a7-WvjQkAT5xmbLs/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true) - Most forecasting questions related to individuals will be resolved (implicitly or explicitly) if the individual in question dies--regardless of whether the question is about their longevity. Many forecasters overlook this, and fail to consider the individual's probability of death.
* [Five Thirty Eight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/) - especially [Polls](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/)
* [Correlates of War](http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets) - especially [Militarized Interstate Disputes](http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/MIDs).
