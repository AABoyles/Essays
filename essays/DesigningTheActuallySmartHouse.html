<p>I have two goals for automating my home: First, I want to waste less energy. Second, I want to do fewer things. In general, all existing home automation products fail to accomplish at least one of these goals well, and particularly the second. Some products connect some of our devices to the internet (and through it, to other connected products), but this by itself doesn’t serve either of my goals. You can control all of your internet-connected things from your smartphone, but that still obligates you to <em>do</em> something. In other words, the <em>automation</em> in home automation is, at present, a lie.</p>
<div id="the-end-goal" class="section level1">
<h1>The End Goal</h1>
<p>I want a house which operates responsively and autonomously. It would <a href="https://www.hunterdouglas.com/">lighten</a> and warm the house in the morning, reducing my incentives to remain in bed. It would make a <a href="http://www.belkin.com/us/F7C050-Belkin/p/P-F7C050%3Bjsessionid%3D54D857A190E9FBC629A8A55C4173C306/">pot of coffee</a>: one cup to drink at home and two more for my thermos, but more if I had visitors. A <a href="http://www.usa.philips.com/c-m-li/light-therapy/wake-up-light/all%23filters%3DWAKEUP_LIGHT_SU%252C2015%252C2014%252C2013%252C2012%252C2011%252C2010%252C2009%26sliders%3D%26support%3D%26price%3D%26priceBoxes%3D%26page%3D%26layout%3D12.subcategory.p-grid-icon">multisensory alarm</a> would wake me in the morning at the <a href="http://www.withings.com/us/en/store/details/70035401">approximately optimal time</a>, given <a href="https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/1314">how long I’d slept, how well I’d slept</a>, and <a href="https://calendar.google.com/">when my earliest obligation for that day</a> was.</p>
<p>As I walk to the bathroom, it would turn on lights just before I can see them and turn them off as I leave their range. It would start the shower to my favorite temperature, along with some music. If the shower was <a href="https://nebia.com/">quiet</a>, it might read me <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html%3FnodeId%3D201601880%26sa-no-redirect%3D1">some news headlines</a> or my current <a href="http://www.audible.com/">audiobook</a>.</p>
<p>Since my waking up always gets the dogs up, it would let them out the backdoor for morning constitutionals, and <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/PetSafe-Healthy-Simply-12-Meal-Automatic/dp/B00VIXRB6O/ref%3Dpd_sbs_199_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26psc%3D1%26refRID%3DJSWWZHVXS74NB6GANE6D">pour food for them</a> once they get back in. As I leave for work, it would <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=smart+locks">lock the house behind me</a>. <a href="https://nest.com/support/article/What-is-Auto-Away">The AC would kick off</a>.</p>
<p>While I’m away, the bots jump to action: <a href="http://www.irobot.com/For-the-Home/Vacuuming/Roomba.aspx">a Roomba vacuums</a>, <a href="http://www.irobot.com/For-the-Home/Mopping.aspx">another mops</a>, a third <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XC34DGX/_encoding=UTF8?coliid=I29JABHDYEONC&amp;colid=123LKSA81H3IN&amp;psc=1">amuses the dogs</a> (if they’re showing it any interest). A <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/search/ref%3Dsr_hi_eb%3Frh%3Dn%253A2972638011%252Cn%253A551242%252Cn%253A128066011%252Cn%253A13638738011%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1472045791">bot mows the lawn</a> when the grass is long and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0095HVAKS/_encoding=UTF8?coliid=I31MSN8L7HWGSM&amp;colid=123LKSA81H3IN&amp;psc=1">conditions are dry</a>. If I am running low on some perishable staple, <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/explore/family-hub-refrigerator/">my refrigerator</a> notifies my phone with a shopping list so I can swing by the grocery store if need be; or, better yet, it can <a href="https://www.peapod.com/">place orders for</a> <a href="https://www.instacart.com/">produce to be delivered</a>, which I can pick up from my doorstep (or even <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?&amp;node=17285120011">inside it</a>) on my arrival home.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vin.li/">As I’m leaving work</a>, <a href="https://workswith.nest.com/company/vinli/vinli-home-connect">the AC comes back on</a>, giving it enough time to cool the house before my arrival. The bots would quit any work they hadn’t finished, to pick it up again the next time I was gone.</p>
<p>While the sun sets, the power source <a href="http://www.solarcity.com/residential/backup-power-supply">transitions from solar to battery</a>. Its modest amount of power storage is more than sufficient to operate the interior lights near me within the house, as well as the entertainment center for a few hours before I go to bed, and continue the air conditioner and refrigerator after I retire.</p>
<p>The whole system wastes little power when it has no chores to accomplish, and accumulates chores only through my interactions with it (and the ordinary wear of time). I believe this is mostly possible with current technology, but no one has attempted to engineer it, instead opting to build smart gadgets to add on to or replace dumb gadgets or infrastructure.</p>
<p>To start building my home of tomorrow today, let’s look at the cornerstone of the whole ecosystem:</p>
</div>
<div id="the-hub" class="section level1">
<h1>The Hub</h1>
<p>As a simple architectural necessity, we’re going to need some device to sit at the center of the whole ecosystem. This device is the hub. There are a few viable options for hubs today. Personally, I own a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-SmartThings-Smart-Home-Hub/dp/B010NZV0GE">Samsung SmartThings hub</a>, which is <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-smart-hub/">adequate</a>. It provides Z-Wave and ZigBee connectivity, which is great! There’s just one problem:</p>
<div class="center-block">
<img src="https://burningbird.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/smartthings.jpg" alt="cabling disasters" />
</div>
<p>It’s another useless brick that you must find power outlets for and hardwire to two other useless bricks (your router and modem). I doubt there’s any good technical reason that these can’t all be consolidated to a single device. It looked like Google might have been moving that direction with the <a href="https://onhub.google.com">OnHub Router</a> (which <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/googlewifi/3Sav5QbVp9I">theoretically supported ZigBee and Weave</a>), but nothing ever came of it before Google pivoted to <a href="https://wifi.google.com">Google WiFi</a>. As a tradeoff, this is one that I’m happy to make: we’ve lost hope of getting ZigBee support in the near future, but we’ve gained <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking">Mesh networking</a>.</p>
<p>Routers suffer from the perennial problem that they need to be in a central location to provide WiFi coverage over the range of a typical house. Unfortunately, they get crammed into corners of basements because that’s where cable jacks are usually installed, and the Modem needs a cable jack and the router needs the modem. Also, it doesn’t help that <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/s/ref%3Dnb_sb_noss_2%3Furl%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%26field-keywords%3DRouter">they’re usually super ugly</a>.</p>
<div class="center-block">
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cHKgrgdEeZmZvBrpDJudcA.jpeg" alt="Kill it with Fire." />
</div>
<p>One (popular) solution is to pump more power into the transmitter. This is slightly undesirable, as it requires more power. Fortunately, there’s a <a href="http://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-alliance-introduces-low-power-long-range-wi-fi-halow">significant engineering push in the opposite direction</a>, with <a href="http://passivewifi.cs.washington.edu/">even more substantial improvements on the horizon</a>.</p>
<p>Google attempted <a href="https://on.google.com/hub/">a different solution</a>, building one that looked kinda sexy so people wouldn’t mind putting it out in the open. The design settled on pleasing curves and a soft, circular light. However, <a href="https://wifi.google.com/">Google’s second solution</a> doubled down on the “get-it-in-the-open” approach. Instead of more power or clever engineering, Google decided to make user-friendly routers that work together automatically. This is an important and valuable step, because it means that Google hopes to distribute these devices across the house. You know what else is good for distributing around the house?</p>
<div class="center-block">
<img src="https://geeksfl.com/wp-content/uploads/voice-assistants-battle.jpg" alt="Voice Assistants" />
</div>
<p>I want a hub device which is attractive, interactive, and useful. In other words, I want the <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Bluetooth-Speaker-with-WiFi-Alexa/dp/B00X4WHP5E/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1471464232%26sr%3D8-1%26keywords%3DEcho">Amazon Echo</a>. Echo is ideally suiting to being the smart house hub. It does a variety of useful things using exclusively voice commands, and it’s quite good at understanding those commands. Gadgets integrated with Echo can be turned on or off, and their settings can be modified. All with no more trouble than it would be to instruct a person to do these things. Fortunately, it looks like Amazon has (at least partly) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075RWFCHB/ref=s9_acsd_al_bw_c_x_5_w?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-4&amp;pf_rd_r=6BF8M4GPRAX75TM8DR99&amp;pf_rd_r=6BF8M4GPRAX75TM8DR99&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=4dc5e960-6892-4959-a18f-2e32ecb3b2b6&amp;pf_rd_p=4dc5e960-6892-4959-a18f-2e32ecb3b2b6&amp;pf_rd_i=9818047011">caught on to this formula</a>.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Somebody should make a single, inexpensive, visually-attractive, voice-assistant-enabled device that does Mesh routing for WiFi, Z-Wave, ZigBee and Bluetooth connectivity. Get on it, Google and Amazon!</p>
</div>
<div id="controlling-the-circus" class="section level1">
<h1>Controlling the Circus</h1>
<p>In general, most “smart” devices really aren’t. Rather, they’re “connected” devices. You can control them with your smartphone. Woohoo. To improve (slightly) on this situation, a plucky little startup called <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> started quietly integrating smart device APIs into a little webapp. The idea is that you give people the ability to set up rules. If This Then That. So, for example, I have a rule that whenever the humidity forecast exceeds 50%, a <a href="http://www.belkin.com/us/F7C027-Belkin/p/P-F7C027/">WeMo Switch</a> automatically turns on my dehumidifier. IFTTT improves the smart device concept substantially, and it sits in the ideal market space for the kind of next-generation IoT management that I have in mind.</p>
<p>Consider <a href="https://nest.com/thermostats/nest-learning-thermostat/overview/">the Nest</a>. Much of The Nest’s utility as an early-mover in the smart home market came from the fact that the Nest knows, and tells <a href="https://nest.com/works-with-nest/">other devices</a>, when you’re home. But there are lots and lots of ways to tell if I’m home or away. Is my phone’s WiFi connected to my home network? Is my phone’s GPS signal at my home? Is my phone’s Bluetooth connected to a device that I leave in my home? Am I scheduled to be away from home on my <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r">Google Calendar</a>? Have I checked in to someplace on <a href="https://facebook.com/">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://foursquare.com/">Foursquare</a> within <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/start">driving time’s distance</a> from my home? While none of these is a slam dunk for determining my home/away status, taken together they can equate to powerful statistical model which should know if I’m home with extremely high accuracy, and good precision. Instead of setting up rigid rules based on schedules and triggers, I want to be able to provide <em>indicators</em> of my status, and <em>responses</em> to statuses.</p>
<p>For a simple example, let’s say I want the house to behave in certain ways when I’m on vacation. This is distinct from the way I want the house to behave when I’m at work or otherwise away for comparatively brief periods. Indicators that I am on vacation may be things like a vacation event blocking off multiple days on my Google Calendar, or a plane flight on my calendar, with a return flight more than 24 hours later. Or my phone’s GPS records locations at driving speeds more than three hours driving hours away from my house. All of these can be integrated into a statistical estimate of my vacation status, and then corrected via a simple app if it is incorrect, which would provide additional training to the algorithm so it would be less likely to make that mistake in the future.</p>
<p>To specify the “certain ways” my vacation status should affect the behaviors of my smart things, I could set responses at the device level. For example, perhaps I’d like my robotic vacuum to do the floors twice: once soon after I leave, and once shortly before I return. If I’m arriving home in the morning or early afternoon, I might like a pot of coffee awaiting me. Etc. While this is all certainly an achievable dream with existing software, it not one that I’ve seen anyone attempt to comprehensively realize. Accordingly, I’m afraid rule-based controls will be (more or less) the sole means of coordinating interactions between “smart” things for the near future.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-well-quantified-self" class="section level1">
<h1>The Well-Quantified-Self</h1>
<p>There’s a small, additional piece of functionality that sort of goes along with this vision. I have yet to find an <a href="http://emberify.com/blog/lifelogging-apps-2016/">autonomous life-logging app</a> that I found satisfactory. I’d love for my phone to record structured data on my activities, simply by recording my GPS locations, Facebook and Foursquare checkins, Google Calendar events, explicit interactions with connected devices, etc. Secondarily, I’d be interested in a similar autonomous event-logging platform showing what my devices were doing at any given time. A few years ago, <a href="http://www.getsaga.com/">Saga</a> was pretty close to what I envision, but it’s definitely abandonware.</p>
</div>
<div id="heating-ventilation-and-air-conditioning" class="section level1">
<h1>Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning</h1>
<p>With respect to energy savings, I believe the home automation gadget market has started in the right place. Namely, Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning systems, which <a href="http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm%3Fid%3D10271">eat the lion’s share of home energy</a>. In this niche, I used to be a big fan of the <a href="https://nest.com/thermostat/meet-nest-thermostat/">Nest smart thermostat</a>. However, it seems that the Nest company has <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/06/nests-time-at-alphabet-a-virtually-unlimited-budget-with-no-results/">more-or-less squandered</a> its head-start in the market. There are plenty of <a href="https://www.ecobee.com/">other</a> <a href="http://yourhome.honeywell.com/home/Products/Thermostats/7-Day-Programmable/Wi-Fi%2BSmart%2BThermostat.htm">promising</a> <a href="http://www.emersonclimate.com/en-us/products/thermostats/sensi/Pages/sensi-wifi-thermostat.aspx">smart</a> <a href="https://customer.honeywell.com/en-US/Pages/Product.aspx%3Fcat%3DHonECC%2520Catalog%26pid%3DYTH8320ZW1007/U%26category%3DZ-WaveTouchscreen%26catpath%3D1.3.12.1.8">thermostats</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="water-heating" class="section level1">
<h1>Water Heating</h1>
<p>It seems to me that the engineers behind the smart house have missed the opportunity to reduce water heating costs (The second-most prominent energy drain). I don’t need hot water around the clock. I need it in the mornings when I shower, and in the evenings when I run my laundry machine and dishwasher. The easiest way to get this is to switch to a <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/s/tankless%252520water%252520heater%3FNCNI-5">tankless heater</a>. But we can do better than that!</p>
<p>What if we had a conventional tank Water Heater that only heated water when we wanted it? Rheem seems to have <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/b/Smart-Home-Smart-Energy-Management-Smart-Water-Heaters/Wi-Fi/N-5yc1vZccuxZ1z0kb2s">an extensive line of WiFi connected water heaters</a>. Now, what if we could achieve that without the overhead of replacing the entire water heater? Enter the <a href="https://aquanta.io/">Aquanta Water Heater Controller</a>.</p>
<p>There’s just one problem: I can’t find any interoperability platform for either the Rheem or the Aquanta products. So, we need a SmartThings- or IFTTT- compatible Water Heating option. Get on it, Appliance manufacturers!</p>
</div>
<div id="laundry" class="section level1">
<h1>Laundry</h1>
<p>There are two really good targets for automating laundry. The first is knowing how to treat the type of load the machine currently contains. Current machines impose a cognitive load on their users by requiring that users understand the settings the machine requires to launder the materials in it properly. I believe that a machine can do this well by itself, using a combination of optical (for color and volume) and weight (for fabric type estimation) sensors. This type of sensing can also extend to determining the optimal settings for drying the clothes. There exist single machines which claim to wash and dry clothes, but they tend <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/s/ref%3Dsr_st_featured-rank%3Frh%3Dn%253A2619525011%252Cn%253A!2619526011%252Cn%253A2383576011%252Cn%253A13755271%26qid%3D1471970233%26sort%3Dfeatured-rank">not to review well</a>. Despite this, the combination is desirable because it completes two discrete actions on the laundry without requiring intervention by the user in the middle of the process (not to mention requiring half the space of the Washer-Dryer combo).</p>
<p>The second is folding. While there was promising proof-of-concept for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dgy5g33S0Gzo">laundry folding robotics</a> a few years ago, it didn’t look like a product was coming to market. Until <a href="https://www.foldimate.com/">Foldimate</a>, that is. You place each article in the grips of the machine, and it folds them, emitting a dainty cube of folded clothes when complete. As of early 2018, it looks like such a product is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/02/its-the-new-year-and-youre-getting-laundry-folding-robots-because-the-1960s-thought-of-everything/">getting closer to comercial viability</a>. But Foldimate is not the solution I want. I wish there were an automated process which would gather the clothes I shed, launder them optimally, dry them efficiently, and place them <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00KK0PICK/ref%3Ddp-kindle-redirect%3F_encoding%3DUTF8%26btkr%3D1">tidily</a> in my drawers (or closet, as the article requires). Sadly, I believe this dream is likely to be another decade away.</p>
<p>What may be more comercially viable is a weekly service which picks up your dirty laundry, treats and cleans it, and returns it folded. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Laundry+service">Early iterations of this concept exist</a>, driven by human labor at all links in the chain (save the washing and drying). As far as I can tell, these services run around $2/pound of clothes. Supposing a load is in the neighborhood of 25 lbs and takes about an hour of labor to wash, dry, and fold, this is a good deal for people valuing their time at more than $50/hour. This time valuation could be refined considerably by factoring in the cost of owning and maintaining washers and dryers (or traveling to laundromats), but the gist is that this seems not to be a particularly good value for most consumers. However, as Amazon drives delivery costs effectively to zero, I suspect that we’ll see growing downward price pressure on services like this. We’re already seeing this for a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/ref=vas_sf_load_?node=8098158011">variety of other services</a>.</p>

<h1>Smart Bathroom</h1>
<p><a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/13-startup-ideas/">YCombinator’s list of Startup ideas</a> mentions one that I’ve been chewing on for awhile: smart bathrooms. Smart Bathroom scales exist and work adequately well (I use a FitBit Aria because it syncs its data via WiFi rather than Bluetooth–honestly, who wants to stand around on a scale fiddling with their phone’s bluetooth connections?), but until pretty recently that was the extent of it. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Smart+Toothbrush">Smart Toothbrushes</a> are starting to look <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/04/hack-pearly-whites-high-tech-toothbrushes/">a little more promising</a>, but there’s so much more low-hanging, raw data available in the bathroom.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about a Smart Toilet: There are two features I’d really like to see in a smart toilet. The first is data collection. Seriously, bear with me: you may be able to infer quite a lot about your digestive health simply from the weight and volume of your excrement. The scale toilet seat <a href="http://www.yankodesign.com/2009/01/07/fat-before-a-visit-to-the-loo-skinny-after/">has been imagined</a>, but I can’t find any indication that anyone is attempting to bring it to the market. A simple set of ascending sensors (just like those used in your car’s gas tank) could measure the volume of the toilet’s contents. A toilet that could infer the phase of matter of its contents could also reduce its own flow volume, saving water. A scale supporting the bowl (but not the seat) could tare after every flush is complete, leaving it ready to measure the weight of the next visitor’s output. Moreover, that approach would free up the seat to accommodate the other thing I want from my smart toilet: a bidet.</p>
<p>The United States seems to be lagging far behind the rest of the world in the <a href="https://www.bidet.org/pages/bidet-buying-guide">bidet business</a>. I’ve never tried one personally, but I feel like a bidet attachment is a strong candidate for desirable smart home improvements. It offers the possibility of automating away most of the work of wiping, trading large wasteful uses of toilet paper for smaller, cheaper expenses of water. If we add energy costs, we can even make some extremely comfortable additional optimizations (like heated water sprays and seats). And this is where it makes sense to connect the bidet to the wider smart ecosystem: there’s no reason to keep a warm seat and water tank for people who aren’t going to visit the toilet for another 10 hours at least. Eventually the home’s AI might even be able to make accurate predictions about who will be getting up at what time of night, and have the toilet ready, while saving energy for the rest of the night.</p>
<p>A smart shower could <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tecboss-Digital-Thermometer-Battery-Temperature/dp/B072M9S14P/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1515082619&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;keywords=Shower+thermometer&amp;psc=1">measure (and report)</a> the temperature of the water used, so individual shower users could get their ideal showering conditions automatically when the house predicts/detects that they’re going to shower. It could track users’ water consumption, and play with the pressure (in the way Nest plays with the temperature) to reduce water consumption.</p>
<p>A smart bathtub could do all the same stuff as the smart shower, with one excellent additional anthrometric. Just like the toilet can determine volume of waste from displacement, the bathtub can do this with your whole body. This might not be especially useful, or it might be <em>extremely</em> interesting. After all, the other obvious anthrometrics (height and weight, from which we infer BMI) frequently mislead impressions about healthy body conditions outside of a surprisingly narrow band around the median body for each sex. Replacing bathtubs is expensive, but inserting a small sensor could be very easy and cheap (although calibrating such a sensor is another matter).</p>

<div id="lighting" class="section level1">
<h1>Lighting</h1>
<p>The fundamental thing I want from my lighting system is for it to turn on while I’m there (and want light), and turn off when I leave. This can be accomplished by old-school (non-connected) home automation technologies like the <a href="http://www.leviton.com/OA_HTML/SectionDisplay.jsp%3Fsection%3D38557%26minisite%3D10251">Leviton occupancy-sensing wall switches</a>. Alternately, you can get smart switches without occupancy-sensing, like the <a href="http://www.belkin.com/us/F7C030-Belkin/p/P-F7C030%3Bjsessionid%3D68FCC9FA139BD26DC3A4EE0EA0C832A4/">Belkin WeMo Light Switch</a>. But I think there’s a huge opportunity to bring these two technologies together.</p>
<p>The problem with occupancy sensing is that you must already be within proximity of the light switch to toggle it. But if you had smart, connected occupancy sensors, you could daisy-chain them together so that as you walked through a hallway, the hallway could detect you, turn on the hall light, and then signal to the switch in your destination room that you’re en route, which would accordingly turn on before you could arrive. I don’t see any products indicating this type of functionality is in development, but one can dream, right?</p>
<p>If we skip the automation and focus on features, colored, connected light solutions (like the <a href="http://www2.meethue.com/en-us/">Phillips Hue</a>) could be cool. Extended to its full potential, I love the idea of lights that interact with the film you’re watching. Can you imagine seeing a police car on-screen, along with the tell-tale flashing red and blue lights bouncing around the room? The problem with this is that it requires either an additional data stream accompanying the film (good luck with that), or an extremely well-trained algorithm working in real-time to infer the appropriate light-scape (which would be horribly annoying every time it screwed up).</p>

<div id="vacuuming" class="section level1">
<h1>Vacuuming</h1>
<p><a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-robot-vacuum/">Robotic Vacuum cleaners</a> have been on the consumer market for a long time, now. Unfortunately, they haven’t been connected to the larger home automation ecosystem until recently. I want a robot vacuum that can run exclusively when I’m not around to trip on it. We can sort of hack around this by setting the Roomba’s scheduler, but (to me) the point of automation is that it is <em>responsive</em> to your behaviors, not dependent on your interacting routinely with its controls.</p>
<p>For example, I can schedule the Roomba to run every morning at 10am, long after I’ve usually left for work. Usually. But when Saturday rolls around, I’d prefer it didn’t run at all, since I’m likely to be home at that time. So I change the scheduler to exclude Saturdays. Now it’s fine, except that next Monday is a holiday, and it’s running again. There’s no sense setting the scheduler since I won’t routinely be home Mondays, but it’s either that or let it run while I’m around. Having it running while I’m around is a minor nuisance, but it’s a nuisance that could be avoided if only the Roomba tapped into a centralized, statistical estimation of whether I was home or not.</p>

<h1>Gardening</h1>
<p>Commercial automation for farming has been advancing for decades, but there hasn’t been nearly as much progress on the consumer side. <a href="https://farmbot.io/">Farmbot</a> looks poised to attempt to change that.</p>
<p>On a more pedestrian note, Automated sprinkler systems exist. I don’t have any opinions to share on this front because I think <a href="https://thenib.com/hate-mowing-your-lawn-good-don-t-do-it">grass lawns</a> are <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/how-america-s-most-useless-crop-also-became-its-most-co-1724553276">incredibly stupid</a> and I would do <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/03/my-town-calls-my-lawn-a-nuisance-but-i-still-refuse-to-mow-it/?utm_term=.26a2f7b9d9d3">literally anything else with that space</a>.

While the iRobot corporation (purveyors of the Roomba) has been <a href="http://www.roboticstrends.com/article/irobot_robot_lawn_mower_too_little_too_late">developing to break into this market</a>, there’s already a <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/search/ref%3Dsr_hi_eb%3Frh%3Dn%253A2972638011%252Cn%253A551242%252Cn%253A128066011%252Cn%253A13638738011%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1472045791">lively selection available</a> (provided you don’t mind burying a low-voltage line around the perimeter of your lawn).</p>
